CAMERA GLIDES slowly, reveals a MAN standing, strap in hand, gently swaying with the train’s movements. His face is hidden to us, but his HAT, set at a mildly rakish angle, is somehow familiar. EXT. STATION - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 2 2 The train comes to a halt. The doors open. The men and women stream out, including the man in the hat. EXT. PICCADILLY CIRCUS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 3 3 The man with the hat emerges into the light and separates from his fellow passengers. He glances about briefly, then continues on. INT. CAFÉ - DAY 4 4 Busy. Loud. As a WAITRESS with a DARK BOB crosses into view, we go with her, wending as she wends, gracefully gliding to a table near the back, where she sets a cup of something hot in front of the man with the hat: DUMBLEDORE. DUMBLEDORE Thank you. WAITRESS Would you like something else? DUMBLEDORE No. Not just yet - I'm waiting. (a frown) I'm expecting someone. The waitress nods and turns away. Dumbledore watches her go, then stirs a lump of sugar into his tea, leans his head back, and closes his eyes. We HOLD on him like this, face in repose, for a long time until... a LIGHT falls over Dumbledore's face. Dumbledore opens his eyes, considers the man standing beside his table: GRINDELWALD. GRINDELWALD Would this be one of your regular haunts? (CONTINUED) Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore FINAL Shooting Script 03/21/2022 1. CONTINUED: 4 4 (CONTINUED) Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore FINAL Shooting Script 03/21/2022 2. DUMBLEDORE I don't have any regular haunts. For a moment, Grindelwald studies him, then sits in the seat opposite. GRINDELWALD Let me see it. Dumbledore stares at him, then slowly brings a hand into view and reveals: the BLOOD TROTH. As he cradles it, its chain slowly slithers between Dumbledore's fingers, as if alive. GRINDELWALD (CONT'D) Sometimes I imagine I still feel it around my neck, I carried it for so many years. How does it feel around yours? DUMBLEDORE We can free each other of it. Grindelwald ignores this, glancing about the room. GRINDELWALD Love to chatter, don't they, our Muggle friends. Though one must admit: They make a good cup of tea. DUMBLEDORE What you're doing is madness- GRINDELWALD It's what we said we'd do. DUMBLEDORE I was young. I was-- GRINDELWALD (CONT'D) --committed.

DUMBLEDORE (CONT'D) No. I went along because- GRINDELWALD Because? DUMBLEDORE Because I was in love with you. They stare into each other's eyes, then Dumbledore looks away again.

It was you who said we could reshape the world, that it was our birthright. Grindelwald settles back, eyes narrow. INHALES. GRINDELWALD (CONT'D) Can you smell it? The stench? Do you really intend to turn your back on your own kind for these animals? Dumbledore's eyes shift, meet Grindelwald's steely gaze. GRINDELWALD (CONT'D) With or without you, I will burn down their world, Albus. There's nothing you can do to stop me. Enjoy your cup of tea. As Grindelwald exits, a LOW RUMBLE begins. Dumbledore stares down at his teacup, watches it faintly TREMBLE on the hard surface of the table. As the liquid within QUIVERS, he seems to get lost in it. We go to flames, holding for some time, until we are in... INT. DUMBLEDORE'S ROOM - HOGWARTS - MORNING 5 5 We find Dumbledore standing at his window, eyes closed. As we slowly pull focus to him, his eyes open, and we are back in the present. He holds the blood troth, the chain coiled around his wrist. EXT. LAKE - TIANZI MOUNTAINS - SAME TIME - NIGHT 6 6 A vast, beautiful landscape. Under a low moon, limestone pillars rise majestically out of the water in the shadow of a MOUNTAIN - the Angel Eye. NEWT paddles across the lake. EXT. TIANZI MOUNTAINS - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT 7 7 Feet delicately step ashore, leaving the bobbing boat behind, and we reveal NEWT SCAMANDER.

The distant cry of an animal echoes evocatively across the landscape. Newt listens for a moment. PICKETT, atop Newt's shoulder, listens too. NEWT (whispers) She's ready. EXT. HOLLOW - TIANZI MOUNTAINS - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT 8 8 Newt moves rapidly but carefully toward the mouth of a great cathedral- like cave. As he draws close, something stirs inside, half hidden in shadow. EXT.

HOLLOW - TIANZI MOUNTAINS - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT 9 9 Newt tenderly reaches out to stroke the back of the animal as she rolls gently, and we see she's a QILIN: part dragon, part horse, powerful but with a sweetness to her. She's breathing fast, her skin flecking and twitching, insects and bits of jungle and dust caked into her hide. She lets out another cry. A GOLDEN LIGHT begins to suffuse the ground beneath her. Newt smiles, entranced. Slowly, slithering out from beneath the mother, a BABY QILIN appears, beautiful and fragile, its eyes blinking blindly. SNIFFING curiously, it softly BLEATS, its tiny body pulsing with GOLDEN LIGHT, briefly illuminating Newt's and Pickett's faces as they peer down at it. Newt steps back, watches as the mother Qilin licks the baby clean as it shivers and stumbles around. NEWT (off Pickett's look) Beautiful. (beat) Right, you two. Now the tricky bit. Newt reaches down for his case, opening it gently. We see a photo of TINA pinned inside the lid. Through the deep undergrowth figures approach, wands being drawn... ...ACOLYTES ROSIER and CARROW approaching, eyes hungrily on the baby Qilin.

With a WHOOSH Rosier and Carrow raise their wands, firing SPELLS, flaying the mother Qilin's hide. She sways drunkenly, BELLOWING into the night, and then - her legs betraying her - collapses. IN THE ONSLAUGHT: Newt sends a defensive spell back and it blooms into a shield, but it's too late. Glancing back to see a DARK FIGURE emerge between the other Acolytes: CREDENCE, looking older, more assured, as he strikes through Newt's shield with his wand. Newt points his wand at his case. NEWT (CONT'D) Accio! The case flies across into his hand. Credence breaks through the shield as Newt pitches himself over the rim of the hollow, dropping down a treacherous slope as he jumps, stumbles, and trips through the undergrowth. A THWACK of a spell from behind, splintering BAMBOO around him, SENDS his case tumbling from his hands. Up ahead we see the baby Qilin standing in the undergrowth, frightened and fragile. Newt picks up the pace, LOOKS ACROSS TO SEE... ...legs pop out of the CASE as it bumps and bounces downhill, steering it back toward him. Carrow jets toward Newt, hands outstretched for the baby Qilin. Newt counters, sending her flying backward. THWACK! Another SPELL whistles over Newt's head just as he ducks and sweeps his arm around the baby Qilin, scooping her up, and in that moment another incoming spell HITS HIM and sends him flying off HIGH GROUND AND DOWN.

For a moment, Newt lies in a dreamlike state, blinking up into the sky. Finally, he raises his head. NEWT'S POV ...ZABINI holds a sack while Rosier reaches over and collects the baby Qilin, shoving it roughly into the sack. WHOOSH! In an instant, they are gone. Newt prizes himself up. We CUT TO: ...Newt stumbling back toward the hollow, one arm wrapped about his case. He reaches the crest of the hollow. The mother Qilin lies in shadow, unmoving. Newt collapses against the mother Qilin's motionless body. His chest heaves painfully. NEWT (CONT'D) I'm so sorry. Newt squints upward, considering the empty sky. His eyelids grow heavy... sleep beckoning... his chest rising more steadily... when: His face BLOOMS SOFTLY with light. His eyes flutter open. The earth beneath him is BLOOMING. Turning, he studies the mother Qilin, watching as the flesh surrounding her eye TWITCHES and... ...a SOFT, MURMURING BLEAT breaks the silence. As the LIGHT at his back BLOOMS BRIGHTER, Newt turns, watching as... ...a SECOND BABY QILIN wriggles into view. As it slips free, it peers around uncertainly, then meets Newt's eyes. Newt smiles before the Qilin wriggles into his arms. He turns back to the mother... then stops. NEWT (CONT'D) Twins. You've had twins... As he watches, a TEAR trickles from her eye, her PUPIL DILATING. Newt's face falls. He rolls back against the mother's lifeless body.

Slowly, Pickett pokes his head out of Newt's pocket, staring at the baby Qilin with wonder. Newt nods to the case and Pickett hops to, pausing over one of the latches, looking back for guidance. Still clasping the Qilin, Newt unfastens one latch while Pickett flips open the other. TEDDY pops his head out, seeing Newt and then looking across at the baby Qilin. From deep below, in the belly of the case, we follow the leggy limbs of a WYVERN as it climbs upward toward the sky, past the picture of TINA GOLDSTEIN stuck to the inside of the case lid, and then Teddy before emerging UP AND OUT of the case into the Angel Eye itself.

The Wyvern's body starts to expand magically and beautifully before us. With his last bit of strength, Newt gathers the Qilin close, pulling it within the folds of his coat. Shivering, it bleats softly in his arms. The tail of the Wyvern wraps around Newt, and he and the baby Qilin are lifted gently into the air. The Wyvern ascends high into the sky, its great majestic wings expanding gracefully as it carries Newt and the baby Qilin over the expansive waterfalls and toward the horizon, which glimmers faintly with the day's first light. The TITLE APPEARS: THE SECRETS OF DUMBLEDORE EXT. CASTLE ENTRANCE/COURTYARD - NURMENGARD - MORNING 10 10 We DRIFT, watching Grindelwald leave the castle as the Acolytes Apparate into the far end of the courtyard. Credence separates from the others. Grindelwald's eyes are fixed on the sack in Credence's hand. Rosier hovers - silent, watchful. Grindelwald steps forward. GRINDELWALD Leave us. The Acolytes withdraw wordlessly. One or two glance back, aware that Credence is now the favorite. Alone with Credence now, Grindelwald nods to the sack.

Grindelwald takes the Qilin and peers deeply into its damp eyes. PHLEGM drizzles from its quivering nose. CREDENCE The others. They said it's special. GRINDELWALD Oh, it's beyond special. See, see its eyes? Those eyes see everything. When a Qilin is born, a righteous leader will rise, to change our world forever. Her birth brings change, Credence, to everything. Credence eyes the Qilin quizzically. GRINDELWALD (CONT'D) You did well. Grindelwald places his hand on Credence's cheek. Credence covers Grindelwald's hand with his own, tentatively, as if unfamiliar with such intimate touch. GRINDELWALD (CONT'D) Go. Rest. INT. DRAWING ROOM - SAME TIME - MORNING 11 11 QUEENIE watches Credence disappear from view, then returns her attention to Grindelwald, who gently lowers the Qilin to the flagstones, eyeing it with evident fascination. Reaching out, he gently lifts it to its feet, steadying it, then positions himself in front of it. For a moment, nothing. Then, slowly, the Qilin's head lifts, its weary gaze meeting Grindelwald's expectant one. Then... ...it turns away. Grindelwald's face hardens. He picks up the Qilin and cradles it in his arms. He reaches into his pocket, something GLIMMERING briefly as he withdraws his hand. Grindelwald's arm rises and... ...blood spatters the flagstones, the glimmering blade in Grindelwald's hand running red. Queenie's breath catches - almost too softly to hear.

THESEUS I don't suppose you'd like to tell me what this is about, would you? NEWT He just asked that we meet. And that I be sure to bring you. THESEUS Right. Theseus studies Newt as they walk ahead into HOGSMEADE. INT. HOG'S HEAD - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 13 13 The bearded proprietor (ABERFORTH DUMBLEDORE) runs a dirty rag over the MIRROR behind the bar, his suspicious gaze shifting as Newt and Theseus, in REFLECTION, enter. As they glance about the squalid surroundings, he continues to clean. ABERFORTH Here to meet my brother, I expect? Newt steps forward. NEWT We're here to see Albus Dumbledore. Aberforth eyes them once more in the mirror, then turns. ABERFORTH That would be my brother. NEWT Oh. Sorry, um... brilliant. I'm Newt Scamander and this is- As Newt extends his hand, Aberforth turns away. ABERFORTH Up the stairs. First on the left. Newt stands with his hand extended another moment, then nods and turns back to Theseus, who raises his eyebrows.

UPPER ROOM - HOG'S HEAD - CONTINUOUS - DAY 14 14 DUMBLEDORE Has Newt told you why you're here? THESEUS Was he meant to? Dumbledore eyes Theseus, clocking the mild challenge in his tone. DUMBLEDORE No, as a matter of fact. Theseus's eyes shift to Newt, who struggles to hold his gaze. NEWT There's something we - that, Dumbledore - wishes to speak to you about. A proposal. Theseus considers his brother, then Dumbledore. THESEUS All right. Dumbledore, having crossed the room, takes the BLOOD TROTH from a table and dangles it in the firelight. DUMBLEDORE You know what this is, of course. THESEUS Newt had it in Paris. I can't say I have much experience with such things, but it looks to be a blood troth. DUMBLEDORE That would be correct. THESEUS And whose blood is contained within? DUMBLEDORE Mine. (a beat) And Grindelwald's. THESEUS I'm assuming that's why you can't move against him?

Theseus nods, eyeing the troth, watching as the droplets of blood circle one another like weights in a clock. THESEUS Can I ask what would possess you to make such a thing? DUMBLEDORE Love. Arrogance. Naivete. Pick your poison. We were young. We were going to transform the world. This ensured we would. Even if one of us had a change of heart. THESEUS And what would happen if you were to fight him? Newt eyes Dumbledore expectantly, but he remains mute, staring at the troth. DUMBLEDORE It's really quite beautiful, you have to admit. Were I even to think about defying it... The blood troth flashes red and flies free, caroming off the floor and to the wall. As he draws his wand, taking aim, the troth's chain, still tethered to his arm, constricts, burrowing deep into his flesh. As Newt and Theseus look on, Dumbledore begins to approach the troth where it grinds into the wall, a strange smile coming over his face, as if he were in thrall to it. DUMBLEDORE (CONT'D) It knows, you see... Dumbledore stares, transfixed. The chain causes the veins in his hand to swell, bulging monstrously. Grimacing, the wand tumbles from his fingers. DUMBLEDORE (CONT'D) It senses the betrayal in my heart... Newt's gaze shifts to the DROPS of BLOOD, now circling one another more frantically within the troth.

Dumbledore continues to stare at the troth as it trembles more violently against the wall and the chain snakes slowly up his throat, encircling his neck... NEWT Albus... ...drawing tighter, then tighter still... NEWT (CONT'D) Albus... ...his eyes rolling up into his head... NEWT (CONT'D) Albus! The blood troth drops to the floor and then into Dumbledore's hand, the chain slithering from his neck and reattaching itself to the troth, its host. Gradually the chain loosens and Dumbledore's chest heaves, as if he'd just remembered to breathe. He opens his hand. In his palm, the troth trembles briefly, then goes still. DUMBLEDORE That would be the least of it. A young man's magic, but as you can see, powerful magic. It can't be undone. THESEUS So this proposal. I take it the Qilin has something to do with it? Dumbledore's eyes shift to Newt. NEWT He promises he won't tell a soul. Dumbledore turns back to Theseus, answers his question. DUMBLEDORE If we are to defeat him, the Qilin is only part of it.

As he watches, a fly crawls along his arm. He watches, transfixed, then his eyes shift. Queenie stands in the doorway. CREDENCE Does he send you? To spy on me? QUEENIE No. But he asks. What you're thinking. What you're feeling. CREDENCE And the others? Does he ask you what they're thinking and feeling? QUEENIE Yes. But it's mostly you. CREDENCE And do you tell him? She starts to reply, then falters. As the veins in his hand lighten, returning to normal, Credence turns, looking at Queenie directly for the first time. CREDENCE (CONT'D) You do? He smiles but there is something unnerving about it. CREDENCE (CONT'D) Who's reading whose mind now? (smile vanishing) Tell me what you see. She eyes him, then: QUEENIE You're a Dumbledore.

And for that reason... for that reason, he's asked you to kill him. Credence's smile has curdled. CREDENCE I want you to go now, Queenie. She nods, makes to exit, then, at the door, stops. QUEENIE I don't. Tell him. Not always. Not everything. She withdraws, closing the door quietly. Credence stands, unmoving for a moment, then the mirror catches his eye. Slowly, as if drawn by an invisible hand, LETTERS begin to MATERIALIZE on the SURFACE of the glass. ...FORGIVE ME... Credence looks unsurprised.

Jacob comes crashing out of the bakery in a cloud of Colonial Girl flour, BANGING the FRYING PAN with a METAL SPOON as he strides across the street. The three workmen circle away from Lally, start toward Jacob. JACOB (CONT'D) That's enough. Get outta here... WORKMAN 1 What's on your mind, baker boy? JACOB Ah, jeez. You should be ashamed of yourselves. Lally watches carefully as the three men close in on Jacob, never taking her eyes from them. JACOB (CONT'D) Tell you what, I'll give you the first shot, go ahead- WORKMAN 1 Are you sure? BANG! Workman 1 drops. Jacob freezes. Seconds later the FRYING PAN comes clattering down to earth as he drops it. The first workman rolls up into a sitting position, rubs his neck. WORKMAN 1 (CONT'D) Last time I ever help that woman out again... Lally! Lally touches her wand to her sad little bob and - in quick succession - her lustrous hair spills forth, the spectacles vanish, and her dowdy dress and stiff collared shirt transform into smartly tailored slacks and a soft, flowing blouse.

He's a wizard. Instantly, Jacob picks up the frying pan and begins to back away, shaking his head. JACOB No! LALLY Please, it's early, don't make me work for it. JACOB I said I wanted out. And I want out. LALLY Come now, Mr. Kowalski- Jacob enters the bakery. JACOB My therapist said you wizards don't exist. What a waste of money!

When she continues to talk, he leaves the shop, still carrying the frying pan. Lally follows him. LALLY (in one long stream) A little over a year ago, in the hopes of securing a small business loan, you walked through the doors of the Steen National Bank - located about six blocks from here - you then made the acquaintance of one Newt Scamander, the world's foremost - albeit only - Magizoologist, you then learned of a world you had previously been wholly unaware of, you met and fell in love with a witch named Queenie Goldstein, had your brain wiped by means of Obliviation, only it didn't take, and - as a result - you reunited with Miss Goldstein who - after your refusal to marry her - decided to join Gellert Grindelwald and his dark army of followers, who pose the single greatest threat to your world and ours in four centuries. How did I do? Jacob sits down and just stares. JACOB Yeah. That's good. Except for the part about Queenie going over to the dark side. I mean, yeah, she's cuckoo, but she's got a heart bigger than this whole crazy island and she's so smart, she can legitimately read your brain, she's a whatchamacallit— LALLY A Legilimens.

I don't know what crazy ideas you have in your head there, lady, but I'm sure as hell you can do a lot better than me. Goodbye. Jacob turns and hobbles slowly toward the dim lights of the bakery. LALLY I don't think we can, Mr. Kowalski. He stops but doesn't turn. LALLY (CONT'D) You could've ducked under the counter, but you didn't. You could've looked the other way, but you didn't.

The door closes, the lights turn out, and the shutters fall over the bakery. Jacob's clothes transform. JACOB (CONT'D) Thanks. LALLY Much better, Jacob. Lally lets the book slip free of her fingers and, boards flapping, it softly flutters in the air, where the pages begin to turn. As she extends her hand, the pages riffle faster and faster, then explode from the binding, dispersing into the air like a kaleidoscope of butterflies. LALLY (CONT'D) I believe you know how this works, Jacob. As their hands touch, the cyclone of pages descends, engulfing them and - SWOOSH! - they VANISH. Seconds later, the pages flutter back into the binding of the book. Seconds after that... all that is left are a few stray pages that float to the ground. EXT.

Although, strictly speaking, that doesn't fall within my purview- Newt turns suddenly and walks to the back of the carriage. The others follow. NEWT All right, then. I imagine you're all wondering why you find yourselves here. General consensus all around. NEWT (CONT'D) And in anticipation of that, Dumbledore asked that I convey a message: Grindelwald has the ability to see snatches of the future. So we have to assume that he'll be able to anticipate what we do before we do it. So if we hope to defeat him, and to save our world... to save your world, Jacob... then our best hope is to confuse him. As Newt concludes, he is greeted with... silence. JACOB Excuse me? I'm sorry, how do you confuse a guy who can see the future? KAMA Countersight. NEWT Exactly. The best plan being no plan. LALLY Or many overlapping plans.

NEWT In fact, Dumbledore asked that I give you something, Jacob. The others stand by as Newt draws forth from his sleeve - a bit like an amateur magician - a WAND. NEWT (CONT'D) It's snakewood. It's somewhat rare-- JACOB Are you kidding me right now? Is this thing real? NEWT (CONT'D) Yes, well, it doesn't have a core, so sort of - but yes. JACOB Sort of real? NEWT More importantly, where we're going, you'll need it. Jacob takes the wand, stares at it in awe. Newt begins to search his pockets. NEWT (CONT'D) Now there's something for you too, I think, Theseus- Again, the others wait in anticipation. Newt - truly like a magician this time - tries to draw out something from inside his coat - but something tugs it back. Newt wrestles for a moment, gives it an extra tug, addressing an inside pocket... NEWT (CONT'D) Teddy, please let go. Teddy, please let go. Teddy. Will you behave. This is Theseus's... With a decisive yank, Teddy caroms across the carriage where he is caught by Jacob. A piece of fabric falls to the floor. Jacob and Teddy stare at each other.

It is a GLITTERING RED TIE patterned with a GOLDEN PHOENIX. He stands and hands it to Theseus, who takes it and turns it over. THESEUS Well, of course, now everything makes sense. NEWT Lally, Lally, I believe you were given some reading material... LALLY You know what they say, a book can take you around the world and back - all you have to do is open it. JACOB (popping Teddy down) She ain't kidding. NEWT Bunty. That's for you. I'm told it's for your eyes only. Newt fishes out a small folded SQUARE of PAPER and hands it to Bunty. As she opens it, she visibly reacts, but before she can give it a second read, it catches fire and incinerates. NEWT (CONT'D) Kama- KAMA I have what I need. JACOB What about Tina? Is Tina coming? NEWT Tina's... not available. Tina's... been promoted. She's... very, very busy. (a beat) From what I understand. LALLY Tina's been made Head of the American Auror Office.

Newt turns, sees Lally standing by the adjacent window, looking out. One man (TALL AUROR) stands out for both his height and demeanor. The train ceases its movement, engine HISSING.

As he exits, a CHILL WIND fills the carriage. Bunty appears at Newt's side. BUNTY I must be going too now, Newt. Newt begins to reply, then stops, looks down, sees that Bunty's hand is entwined with his own on the case's handle. BUNTY (CONT'D) No one can know everything. Not even you. He looks up at her, but she says nothing more. Finally, he releases the handle. As she goes, Newt clocks Theseus and Jacob watching him. Turning away, Newt looks back out the window, watching as Kama and Bunty head in opposite directions. EXT. STREET - BERLIN - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT 27 27 A LIGHT SNOW FALLS as Jacob, Newt, Lally, and Theseus move through the street. NEWT Right... Well, here it is. Newt leads them into an alleyway toward a BRICK WALL bearing a CREST. As the others stride toward the wall, Jacob glances from side to side and up and about when... WHOOSH. ...the four of them have passed through to the other side. Jacob frowns and sees the same brick wall and the same crest - only depicted from the back.

Newt and the others weave their way toward the steps. As Theseus leads the others through the throng and toward the Ministry entrance, one of the GERMAN AURORS stationed along the perimeter tries to impede Lally and Jacob from ascending the steps. THESEUS Evening, Helmut. HELMUT Theseus. THESEUS Hey. They're with me. The Auror blocking them sees Theseus, and his eyes flicker with recognition. He glances to the COMMANDING AUROR (HELMUT) overseeing all at the top of the stairs, who nods. Theseus leads the others up. Just then, the mob surges. Rosier and Carrow are pushing forward through a group of Santos supporters to the concussive beat of drums.

HOG'S HEAD - SAME TIME - NIGHT 32 32 Dumbledore and Aberforth sit across from each other in the empty pub, eating. Their spoons dipping into the bowls in front of them is the sole sound for a time. DUMBLEDORE (the soup) That's very good. Aberforth continues to eat. DUMBLEDORE (CONT'D) Her favorite. Remember how she begged Mother to make it - Ariana - Mother claimed it calmed her.

Dumbledore studies his brother, burdened by the distance between them, then begins to return to his own bowl when - suddenly - a RAPPING is heard. Aberforth CALLS OUT GRUFFLY: ABERFORTH (CONT'D) Read the sign, you stupid sod! Dumbledore looks toward the FAMILIAR SHADOW beyond the entrance, rises. INT./EXT.

NEWT The man that I'm inquiring about is the Head of the British Auror Office! How can you have misplaced the Head of the British Auror Office! The official, turning to face him, stares placidly at Newt. MINISTRY OFFICIAL It's our contention that since he was never in our custody, we never misplaced him. LALLY Sir. There were dozens of people there. Any one of them can corroborate- MINISTRY OFFICIAL And your name is? The official looks into Lally's eyes when: JACOB Let's get out of here... Hey! Wait!

CROWDED STREET - BERLIN - DAY 47 47 Dumbledore, walking briskly, heads through the Berlin streets. Credence follows behind. Dumbledore crosses the street and slowly comes to a stop in front of a shop, where he sees Credence, in the reflection of the window, visible behind and between passing cars. Dumbledore slowly blows on a snowflake, and it transforms into a water droplet. We follow the drop as it flies into the window like a translucent bullet and over the reflected view of the trams and cars, traveling across to Credence, breaking on his forehead. As it bursts, the sound of the street melts away, becoming distant. DUMBLEDORE Hello, Credence.

CREDENCE I'm a Dumbledore. You abandoned me. The same blood that runs my veins runs yours. The PHOENIX swoops past; Dumbledore glances up at it. The dark energy emanating from within Credence starts to ripple outward, cracking the pavement, lifting the tram rails up around them. Dumbledore studies the energy, recognizing it, all the while the world around seems to continue on as normal. CREDENCE (CONT'D) He's not here for you. He's here for me. The ground starts to splinter and break around Credence. Dumbledore tenses, sensing what may be coming. A GREEN BOLT spits from Credence's wand. Dumbledore parries it, his movements smooth, wicked-fast. Instantly, Credence advances and fires another spell, lifting the ground and smashing it forward around Dumbledore, who dissipates the explosive onslaught before he Apparates out of the way. Credence is running now, lifting cars, masonry, glass from windows, all collecting and sending a rippling, seismic earthquake ahead of him, toward Dumbledore. Before Dumbledore can parry any further, Credence is upon him, the two locked arm in arm as they duel. Behind them, a TRAM is approaching and Dumbledore Apparates backward.

Credence, suddenly aware of a wand at his neck, turns to see Dumbledore standing behind him. Dumbledore lifts the DELUMINATOR. DUMBLEDORE Things are not quite what they appear, Credence.

BRITISH WITCH You're not actually proposing that man be allowed to stand-- VOGEL (CONT'D) Yes! Yes, let him stand! Below, Rosier, white as a ghost, steps out of the car and watches Grindelwald move through the crowd. BRITISH WITCH (CONT'D) Gellert Grindelwald wants Muggle- Wizard war! And if he gets his wish, he won't just destroy their world, he'll destroy ours as well. VOGEL Which is why he cannot win! Let him stand as a candidate. Let the people vote. When he loses, the people will have spoken. But deny them their voices... and those streets will run with blood.

PASSAGEWAY - ERKSTAG PRISON - NIGHT 54 54 A tiny fluttering blob of light approaches. As it draws closer, Newt comes clear. He stops. NEWT Theseus! Tiny movements can be heard in the surrounding shadows. Newt crouches, swings the lantern. A tiny crab-like creature - a BABY MANTICORE - scuttles into view. Seeing Newt, it waggles its antennae. It is - there's simply no denying it - adorable. Newt seems less than charmed. As he watches, another baby Manticore appears, then another, then another still. One peers up, bares TEETH. Not adorable. Newt backs away into a central atrium, his feet at the edge of a great pit. He looks down into the vast, dark hole. Something stirs in the shadows below. Newt suddenly adopts an odd, crab-like pose. The baby Manticores copy him. INT. GRAND HALL - GERMAN MINISTRY - NIGHT 55 55 Plates of lobster are being ferried to tables.

Then, abruptly, the energy in the room shifts and Grindelwald and his entourage stumble into the room in high spirits. Hair askew, jacket rumpled, Grindelwald seems rakishly authentic in this room of wheezing wannabes. He turns to the HOUSE ELF QUARTET to resume playing. He moves through the room, trailed by Rosier, Queenie, Kama, Carrow, Zabini, and Acolytes. As Queenie crosses, Jacob rises. JACOB Queenie... Queenie. Queenie knows he's there but blanks him completely. GRINDELWALD (spotting Santos) Madam Santos. A pleasure. Your supporters are in fine voice. SANTOS (a steely smile) As are yours, Mr. Grindelwald. Grindelwald constructs a smile. INT. FAR PASSAGEWAY - ERKSTAG - NIGHT 56 56 Theseus hangs from his ankles in a small cell. As a CLATTERING SOUND RISES, he peers down the passageway, watching as Newt comes into view, doing an odd sidelong scissor walk, trailed by HUNDREDS of BABY MANTICORES, all of whom appear to be mimicking him. THESEUS Rescuing me, are you? NEWT That's the general idea. THESEUS (Newt's scissor walk) I presume this - whatever it is that you are doing - is strategic?

Theoretically. I've only actually attempted it once before. THESEUS And the results? NEWT Inconclusive. Also, that was a laboratory setting and the conditions were strictly controlled, and the current conditions are more volatile, making it less predictive of ultimate outcome. THESEUS Ultimate outcome presumably being our survival. Newt remains very still as a huge ANTENNA emerges from the darkness below. Theseus and Newt stare at each other in alarm. Newt delicately turns to the antenna, it studies him for a moment, then the lamplight in the cell adjacent to Theseus's sputters out. The antenna retreats down and a giant, scorpion-like tail plunges into the now-dark cell, retrieving the cocooned body that's in there and pulls it down into the pit below. A beat.

Newt raises his lantern to reveal it's been disemboweled, food now for the horde of Manticores that tumble over to feast.

THESEUS I'm swiveling like you're swiveling, Newt. NEWT I don't believe you are. Between them, a second LAMP outside a cell entrance goes out, and the tail comes up and takes another body.

Across the room, Jacob stares intently at her. We HOLD on them, lost in each other, the surrounding world irrelevant and fading, until... GRINDELWALD Go to him.

Lally approaches but is stopped by two bodyguards. JACOB Oh boy... Jacob approaches Grindelwald's table like a man on a swaying ship. As Santos raises her glass, the ruby-red liquid rises into the air menacingly. Lally discreetly sends a spell, and the liquid hovering above Santos's glass zooms down the high table and hits a door, corroding the wood. As Jacob arrives at the table, Grindelwald, only just now aware of him, eyes him mildly. JACOB (CONT'D) Let her go. GRINDELWALD Excuse me? Jacob draws his wand. NORWEGIAN MINISTER Assassin! Lally turns, looking back in disbelief as Jacob now holds up both hands. WHOOSH! Lally flicks her wand again, and Jacob's arm holding the wand is thrust vertically into the air. A tornado-like VORTEX consumes the room, as if the contents of the room were tossed in a blender. Lally quickly sends another spell, tying the bodyguard's shoelaces together. Guests flee as each and every chandelier is TREMBLING and the draperies are billowing along the wall, the tablecloths are pitching to and fro, and napkins are taking flight like doves.

They are sucked into the book. INT. ERKSTAG PRISON - SAME TIME - NIGHT 60 60 The Warder SNORTS, his chair tipping backward. Teddy - one end of the glittering necktie clenched in his teeth - skates forward, the pads of his tiny feet SQUEAKING across the surface of the desk. Above, Pickett precariously balances on the edge of one of the cubbyholes, trying to retrieve Newt's wand. BELOW, as the Warder wakes, the chair steadies. Then... It falls back as the knot in the tie is finally pulled undone and the Warder crashes like a tree that's been felled, SMASHING into the cubbyholes and launching Pickett forward. Teddy leaps up, ignoring Pickett in midair, and grabs some falling coins before crashing to the ground. The WHISTLE echoes again. INT. CELLBLOCK - ERKSTAG - SAME TIME - NIGHT 61 61 The lamplight in Theseus's hand is frittering in and out. We hear a crunch, and Theseus stops. The baby Manticores suddenly pause, staring.

In that instant, the light in Theseus's lamp fizzles out, plunging them both into darkness and sending the baby Manticores running away. The HUGE tail lifts up, starts to recoil to strike. As one, the brothers bolt, the tail smashing into the cell walls feet away from them. Newt and Theseus race through corridors, the Manticore's tail and antennae whipping, SNAKING, smashing, and sending fiery bolts after them, followed by the GIANT MANTICORE itself, squeezing through crevices, close in pursuit. Theseus swings right and races precariously along a ledge as the Manticore ferociously bears down upon him. Eyes, claws, limbs of the beast flail toward him, before Theseus trips left, just avoiding the limb that has almost skewered him. Newt and Theseus reunite and rush forward as the ceiling collapses behind them, trapping the Giant Manticore. Theseus breathes a sigh of relief just before one of the Manticore's antennae snakes around his waist and drags him away. Newt desperately follows, grabbing at his brother.

If I'd been a better brother, he might have confided in me. Perhaps things would have been different. This boy could have been part of our lives. Part of our family. (a beat) Credence can't be saved, I know you know that. But he may yet be able to save us. As Newt reacts, Dumbledore holds up his hand, fingers stained with soot. DUMBLEDORE (CONT'D) Phoenix ash. The bird comes to him because he's dying, Newt. I know the signs.

Stunned. DUMBLEDORE (CONT'D) And like Credence, she never learned to express her magic. Over time it grew darker and began to poison her. Dumbledore looks to the painting. DUMBLEDORE (CONT'D) Worst of all, none of us were capable of easing her pain. NEWT Can you tell me how it is - how it came to an end for her? DUMBLEDORE Gellert and I had made plans to go away together. My brother didn't approve. One night, he confronted us. Voices were raised. Threats made. Aberforth drew his wand, which was foolish. I drew my wand, which was even more foolish. Gellert just laughed. No one heard Ariana coming down the stairs. Dumbledore's eyes glitter as he stares at the painting. DUMBLEDORE (CONT'D) I can't say for certain it was my spell. It doesn't really matter. One minute she was there, and the next she was gone... His voice trails off. NEWT I'm so sorry, Albus. If it's of any comfort, perhaps she was saved some pain- DUMBLEDORE Don't. Don't disappoint me, Newt. You of all people. Your honesty is a gift, even if at times a painful one.

Dumbledore doesn't turn, just stares at the painting. EXT. NURMENGARD CASTLE - LATE DAY 67 67 The camera circles high across the slate sky above the castle. Far below, we see an ARMY OF DARK-CLAD FIGURES assembled. As Grindelwald and Credence make their way toward the castle, the figures part. Reaching the entrance, Grindelwald turns, surveying them. GRINDELWALD Our time is close, my brothers and sisters. The days of hiding are over. The world will hear our voice. And it will be deafening. A ROAR goes up amongst the throng. Grindelwald smiles faintly, then his eyes fix on Kama, standing to one side in front of the cheering Acolytes, somehow both a part of the throng and separate. Grindelwald steps over to him and, to Kama's surprise, takes his face in both hands. GRINDELWALD (CONT'D) You didn't come here to betray Dumbledore. You know in your pure- blood heart your place is here. To believe in me is to believe in yourself. He stares deeply into Kama's eyes one more moment and walks him down into the crowd, gently pushing him into the assembled troops.

Then releases him, before turning for the castle. INT. CELLAR - NURMENGARD - MOMENTS LATER - LATE DAY 68 68 CLOSE ON - THE DEAD QILIN. As the limp creature's head flops to one side, the laceration across its throat is revealed. ...UNDERWATER, looking upward through a strangely undulating surface. All is eerily SILENT, like a dream, then a FIGURE appears— indistinct through the liquid—cradling something. The figure PLUNGES his hands into the water and the face of the DEAD QILIN turns our way. Blood blooms from its ragged throat. NEW ANGLE - GRINDELWALD He stands waist-deep in a pool, shirtsleeves rolled up past his elbows, holding the Qilin underwater as he murmurs indistinctly. He waits for the water to grow still, then WHISPERS: GRINDELWALD Rennervate... Credence, Vogel, and Rosier watch from the shadows. With great tenderness, Grindelwald plays his fingers over the Qilin's throat, mending the flesh there. BUBBLES rise from the pool. The Qilin's head breaks the surface and it SCREECHES. Grindelwald lifts it from the water. GRINDELWALD (CONT'D) Vulnera Sanentur... As the scars vanish under his fingertips, the Qilin turns its head to him, its eyes still eerily vacant, but otherwise appearing healthy and whole. Grindelwald smiles, strokes it. GRINDELWALD (CONT'D) There, there. There, there... (without turning) Come look. Vogel glances away, staying put,"

To conceal our powers is not merely an affront to ourselves. It's sinful. Grindelwald places the Qilin at the side of the pool, where it stays standing. Credence studies the newly reborn Qilin, bewitched. Gratified by Credence's reaction, Grindelwald looks back to the Qilin... then stops, his smile faltering. A PALE SHADOW, identical to the Qilin in his hands, appears briefly within the currents of the water. His eyes harden. GRINDELWALD (CONT'D) Was there another? CREDENCE Another? GRINDELWALD That night. Was there another Qilin? In the shadows, Vogel turns, looks back to the pool. Grindelwald's eyes are pinched with fury. Credence, his face pale and slick, looks suddenly uneasy. CREDENCE I don't think so- With frightening speed, Grindelwald throws Credence back from the pool with a powerful burst of water and pins him to the wall. Grindelwald Apparates from the water, his fingers laced about Credence's throat and face. His eyes glitter with anger. GRINDELWALD That's twice you've failed me! Do you not understand the danger you've put me in?! Credence remains frozen like a terrified child under Grindelwald's grip. GRINDELWALD (CONT'D) One last chance. Understood? Find it. INT.

INT. 7TH FLOOR CORRIDOR - HOGWARTS - SAME TIME - MORNING 71 71 We follow Lally, Newt, Theseus, and Jacob toward an ornate door emerging from the wall at the far end of the corridor. INT.

(as the others eye him) Like a shell game thing. Like a short con. (giving up) Never mind, it's a Muggle thing. DUMBLEDORE Grindelwald will do anything within his power to get his hands on our rare friend. Therefore it's essential we keep whoever he dispatches on his behalf guessing so the Qilin gets to the ceremony safely. If by teatime, the Qilin - not to mention all of us - are still alive, we should consider our efforts a success. Dumbledore puts his hat on and wraps a scarf around his neck. JACOB For the record, no one ever died playing three-card monte. DUMBLEDORE An important distinction. All right, everyone choose a case and we'll be on our way.

Jacob picks up the case. Nods. Glances around. Frowns. No exit. The Bhutanese prayer wheel glitters in front of Dumbledore. He reaches out, touches it, and a beautiful glow fills the room. DUMBLEDORE I'm looking forward to you educating me a little further on the finer points of three-card monte. He looks over to Jacob, reaches out his hand to him. JACOB My pleasure. Jacob takes Dumbledore's hand, and together they disappear into the wheel as it rapidly spins. As they vanish, the others consider the remaining cases. BUNTY Well, good luck, everybody.

A crowd gathers at the base of an enormous set of steps that climb toward the sky, on top of which sits the magnificent Eyrie. A figure stands in front of a gilded cage set beneath the steps. VOGEL It is not lost on those of us in leadership that we are currently a world divided. Each day brings talk of another conspiracy. Vogel's speech is seen projected into Magical Ministries around the world. VOGEL (CONT'D) Each hour another dark whisper. These whispers have only increased in recent days with the addition of a third candidate. There is only one way to leave absolutely no doubt that a worthy candidate exists amongst the three who have been presented. Vogel enters the golden cage and emerges with something cradled in his arms. As he resumes his place and slowly reveals what he holds, there is a palpable GASP. A Qilin. VOGEL (CONT'D) As every schoolboy and girl knows: The Qilin is the purest of creatures in our wonderful, magical world. It cannot be deceived. (holding it before him) Let the Qilin unite us! EXT.

VOGEL I thank the candidates for their words... EXT. EYRIE - BHUTAN - CONTINUOUS - DAY 94 94 Liu, Santos, and Grindelwald stand side by side. VOGEL Each represents a distinct vision of how we will shape not only our world, but the non-magical world as well. Which brings us to the most important part of our ceremony. The walk of the Qilin. A Qilin is brought forth. We CUT TO: EXT. EYRIE - BHUTAN - SAME TIME - DAY 95 95 Newt reaches the great steps that stretch up to the Eyrie, seeing a tiny figure up ahead with his case - Fischer. As he pounds up the steps, he looks across to the banners and sees the Qilin being put before Grindelwald, Liu, and Santos. A QUICK TOUR AROUND THE WORLD, as dignitaries at MAGICAL MINISTRIES, in EUROPE and elsewhere, watch the ceremony. On the screen the Qilin moves tentatively forward - toward the candidates. As the Qilin moves toward Grindelwald, Liu and Santos exchange a glance. Newt charges toward Fischer, who simply turns to look at Newt, making no effort to move. The Qilin stands in front of Grindelwald and gazes up at him. Fischer holds out the case. Newt studies her, perplexed by her demeanor, then reaches out. As his fingers make contact, the case turns to dust. In a panic, he watches the particles drift into the air. He looks back to Fischer, who continues to smile.

The Qilin, in front of Grindelwald, bows. For a moment, there is a long beat of silence. VOGEL The Qilin has seen. Seen goodness, strength, qualities essential to lead, and to guide us. Who do you see? The assembled witches and wizards thrust their wands into the air. SPELLS explode. The THREE COLORS of Liu, Santos, and Grindelwald stream into the sky and then turn to one, Grindelwald's green. Newt stands stunned. Grindelwald savors the adulation. VOGEL (CONT'D) Gellert Grindelwald is the new leader of the magical world by acclamation. As the crowd ROARS, Acolytes on either side of Newt shove him up the steps. Grindelwald nods to Rosier and she brings forth Queenie and Jacob. Newt tries to push his way toward Queenie and Jacob, but the two Acolytes restrain him. Rosier brings Jacob farther up the steps and hands his snakewood wand to Grindelwald. Grindelwald surveys the crowd, who waits, eyes fixed on him, then gestures to Jacob. GRINDELWALD This is the man who tried to take my life. This man who has no magic, who would marry a witch and pollute our blood. This forbidden union will make us less, make us weak, like his kind. He is not alone, my friends. There are thousands who seek to do the same. There can only be one response to such vermin. Grindelwald tosses away Jacob's wand and raises his own.

As Jacob turns to face him, Grindelwald hits him with a spell that throws him down the steps and sends him sprawling onto his back at Queenie's feet. GRINDELWALD (CONT'D) Crucio! A lightning spell sends Jacob writhing in pain at Queenie's feet. NEWT No! QUEENIE Make him stop! GRINDELWALD Our war with the Muggles begins today! Grindelwald's SUPPORTERS CHEER wildly. Lally, Theseus, and Kama can be seen moving through the crowd, looking shocked. Jacob remains writhing in pain on the ground until Santos raises her wand and lifts the Cruciatus Curse afflicting him. Relieved, Jacob lies back in Queenie's arms. Grindelwald turns his face to the sky, basking in his glory. He stays like this, reveling in the moment when... ...he spies the Phoenix circling overhead. A solitary feather of ASH seesaws from the sky and attaches itself to his cheek. He wipes it away, looking troubled. Grindelwald turns, squinting, as a FIGURE emerges from the steps... Credence.

Nearing the end of his strength, Credence falls to his knees. Aberforth moves to help him, but is held back gently by Dumbledore. DUMBLEDORE Not now. Wait. Newt pulls free of his captors. NEWT He did it to trick you. He killed it and bewitched it so that you might think him worthy to lead. But he doesn't want to lead you, he just wants you to follow. GRINDELWALD Words. Words designed to deceive. To make you doubt what you've seen with your own two eyes. NEWT There were two Qilins born that night. A twin. And I know that, I know that-- GRINDELWALD (CONT'D) Because... ? Because you have no proof. Because there was no second Qilin. Am I not right? NEWT (CONT'D) Its mother had been killed. GRINDELWALD Then where is it now, Mr. Scamander? Grindelwald looks at Newt, triumphant, when his gaze falls to a green-robed dignitary... She steps forward, into the light, a CASE in hand, and gives it to Newt, who stares at it, dumbfounded. The robed figure looks up to reveal... Bunty. BUNTY No one can know everything, Newt. Remember? She glances around, abruptly - and uncomfortably - aware of the dignified persons present, then moves away as Newt opens the lid of the case.

Vogel stares incredulously, nervously eyeing Grindelwald, who looks unsettled as well. Theseus and Lally exchange stunned glances. Tina watches on from the AMERICAN MINISTRY. Newt, more stunned than anyone, smiles - looking relieved, grateful. As everyone watches, the Qilin crawls out of the case and stands upright, blinking in confusion, trying to get its bearings. Then, sensing something, it turns and sees: The bewitched Qilin, standing by Grindelwald's side. Instantly, the Qilin SOFTLY KEENS, calling out, the sound heartbreaking in its naked emotion, but its twin's expression remains unchanged, its eyes blank. Newt kneels down beside the confused Qilin. NEWT (softly) She can't hear you, little one. Not here. But perhaps somewhere she's listening in... VOGEL This is the true Qilin! Vogel snatches up the bewitched Qilin and turns to"

The Qilin eyes him carefully, its probing eyes silencing Dumbledore. The Qilin begins to glow and then slowly bows. Newt looks on curiously, compassionately. DUMBLEDORE (CONT'D) I'm honored. (a troubled beat) Just as two of you were born that night, there is another here. Equally worthy. I'm certain of it. Dumbledore gently strokes the Qilin. DUMBLEDORE (CONT'D) Thank you. The Qilin eyes Dumbledore curiously before making its way toward Santos to bow, as Grindelwald watches on with disgust. Grindelwald looks at Dumbledore, consumed by the moment - and raises his wand toward the Qilin. Credence, seeing Grindelwald taking aim at the Qilin, summons what strength he has and stands before him. Lightning fast, Grindelwald turns and casts a spell toward CREDENCE WHEN... ...a BRIGHT, BLINDING SHIELD OF LIGHT materializes in front of Credence, courtesy of... ...Dumbledore and Aberforth, who - reflexively - independently - have cast protective spells. As Grindelwald's spell strikes the SHIMMERING SHIELD OF LIGHT, we follow his gaze up the path of the spell and discover... ...his and Dumbledore's spells have knotted together. As one, their gazes meet, each stunned to find themselves shackled to the other. For a moment, they remain like this, connected, each draining the power of the other, the world in suspension. Then: The troth's CHAIN SHATTERS, sending the CRYSTAL slowly spinning to the ground. Grindelwald and Dumbledore watch as the light from the troth begins to FLICKER, and with a FLASH, everything goes suddenly silent...

Instantly, their wands rise, FLASHING again and again—fire and parry, fire and parry—in a dizzying—and cathartic—display of power. As they continue to battle, they draw closer and closer, neither able to get the best of the other, neither willing to concede, until finally, nearly face-to- face, their arms cross and they... Stop. Chests heaving. Eyes locked on each other. Dumbledore reaches out, delicately puts his hand on Grindelwald's heart. Grindelwald does the same, hand on Dumbledore's. Dumbledore, head bowed, peers up into Grindelwald's eyes. Just then, a THIN THREAD of YELLOW LIGHT stitches its way up into the sky from the crowd below. Moments later, another THREAD of YELLOW LIGHT joins it. Then another. Grindelwald watches, his face betraying an impending dread. Dumbledore watches more threads of light knit their way into the sky and, looking strangely moved, turns away, making to rejoin the frozen world behind him. Grindelwald stands stricken. GRINDELWALD Who will love you now, Dumbledore? The blood troth strikes the floor. CRACK. It breaks in two, and smoke rises from its center... The world begins to rotate on its axis once more, the figures surrounding Grindelwald and Dumbledore coming back to life. Dumbledore doesn't turn, leaving Grindelwald behind, to stand alone.

MAGICAL MINISTRIES around the world, including Brazil and France, cheer for Santos, sending their own exploding yellow spells into the air. Grindelwald looks on, defeated. He gazes over at those who oppose him, unified now as they move toward him, led by Santos and the Qilin, pointing their wands in his direction. Apparating to the edge, Grindelwald stands backed to the precipice of a great cliff. He rapidly puts a shield around him as spells are cast from those who stand opposite. But there is only one person who interests him: Dumbledore. GRINDELWALD (CONT'D) I was never your enemy. Then or now. Almost as ONE, spells fly toward Grindelwald, when, with one final glance at Dumbledore... he falls backward and Apparates. Theseus, Lally, and Kama, followed by others, race to the wall edge to see... He's gone. Dumbledore looks away, sees Aberforth cradling Credence. Credence is weak now, looking at Aberforth curiously, his face bathed in yellow light. CREDENCE Did you ever think of me? ABERFORTH Always. Come home.

Funny how historic days seem so ordinary when you're living them. NEWT Perhaps that's what happens when the world gets things right. DUMBLEDORE It's jolly nice to know it happens occasionally.

He raises the Elder Wand. INT. THESTRAL-DRAWN CARRIAGE - NIGHT 9 9 GRINDELWALD'S rapid transformation into a tongueless ABERNATHY is almost complete. SPIELMAN (shocked) Oh! EXT. THESTRAL-DRAWN CARRIAGE - NIGHT 10 10 Now fully transformed, GRINDELWALD Disapparates from the underside of the carriage... ...and Apparates next to the driver's seat, where he is spotted by AURORS 1 & 2. GRINDELWALD points his wand at the carriage reins, turning the black ropes into living snakes that ensnare AUROR 1 so he falls from the carriage, back through the night sky, past the broomstick riders. GRINDELWALD casts another spell so the black ropes of the reins bind AUROR 2 like a chrysalis, launching him forward in the air, then slingshotting him back to knock AURORS 3 & 4 from the rear of the Thestral-drawn carriage. They fall away into darkness. INT. THESTRAL-DRAWN CARRIAGE - NIGHT 11 11 All wands reverse their direction to jab dangerously at the necks of SPIELMAN and the two remaining AURORS. SPIELMAN watches as his wand melts into dust. The carriage rocks dangerously, both doors open. As GRINDELWALD'S head appears at the window, the panicking SPIELMAN opens the wand box on his lap. The Chupacabra leaps out and sinks its fangs deep into SPIELMAN'S neck. He wrestles it. The vial falls to the floor. Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 2017/11/16 4.

The broomstick riders are catching up. GRINDELWALD touches the Elder Wand to the river and at once the inside of the carriage begins to fill with water. He lifts the carriage back up into the air.

STEBBINS is immediately caught in a hurricane for one. To the confusion and amusement of passing Muggles, his hat flies away, he is almost knocked off his feet, and cannot proceed. Smiling slightly, NEWT withdraws his head, still leaning against the wall of the dark alleyway, to find a single black glove hanging in the air in front of him. He looks at it, expressionless. It gives a little wave, then points into the far distance. NEWT looks to where it is pointing. High on the dome of St. Paul's Cathedral, a tiny human figure raises its arm. NEWT looks back at the glove, which makes as though to shake hands. NEWT takes it, and he and the glove Disapparate -- EXT. DOME OF ST.

DUMBLEDORE That's what they're whispering. Pureblood or not, I know this: An Obscurus grows in the absence of love as a dark twin, an only friend. If Credence has a real brother or sister out there who can take its place, he might yet be saved. (beat) Wherever Credence is in Paris, he's either in danger or a danger to others.

BUNTY I'm so sorry, Newt, they must have picked the lock while I was cleaning out the Augureys -- NEWT Not to worry. NEWT and BUNTY walk together among the enclosures. BUNTY Hmm...

NEWT (CONT'D) Seriously, you go home now, Bunty. You must be exhausted. BUNTY You know the Kelpie's easier with two. They approach the water. NEWT unhooks a bridle hanging beside the pond. BUNTY (CONT'D) (hopeful) Perhaps you should take off your shirt? NEWT (oblivious) Don't worry, I'll dry off quickly enough. NEWT smiles and jumps backward into the water.

A few misshapen and particularly downtrodden humanoids -- UNDERBEINGS without powers but of magical ancestry -- shuffle around, taking money from the crowd. Horns hidden beneath hats, unusual eyes beneath hoods; HALF- ELVES and HALF-GOBLINS juggle and tumble.

There is something wrong. They proceed toward the stairs. INT. 18 RUE PHILIPPE LORAND, LANDING OUTSIDE MAID'S ROOM - 56 56 DAY CREDENCE and NAGINI reach the landing. A door stands ajar. A shadow cast by lamplight: what seems to be a woman, sewing. The shadow pauses in its work. NAGINI is edgy, nervous, looking around. IRMA (O.S.) (in French) Qui est là? CREDENCE can neither move nor speak. NAGINI realizes this. NAGINI (in French) C'est votre fils, madame. She takes CREDENCE'S hand and pulls him gently into the room.

The perfectly camouflaged GRIMMSON emerges from the wall, raises his wand, aims for the silhouetted figures, and dispatches a Killing Curse that sears through the sheets and clothing, leaving smoldering holes. We hear a body fall. NAGINI screams. CREDENCE'S shadow has vanished. Grinning, certain of triumph, GRIMMSON slashes away the smoking fabric until he stands facing -- IRMA, dead on the floor, and NAGINI, who backs away from him. Slowly, his grin fading, GRIMMSON looks up at the ceiling. The Obscurus is swirling there like thick black smoke. In a flash, GRIMMSON conjures a domed Shield Charm around himself and IRMA'S body. And the Obscurus dives, pelting the Shield Charm like a million bullets, rising and re-forming and diving again, but though the magical barrier trembles, it is not broken. Now the Obscurus expands in fury, smashing apart the attic like a tornado. GRIMMSON smiles up at the Obscurus: We'll meet again. He Disapparates. Mingling with the debris of the destroyed attic, the Obscurus slams inward and CREDENCE re-forms. He stands looking down at the tiny body. EXT.

He removes his hand and stares at his reflection. WE CLOSE IN: A tiny tentacle is visible at the corner of his eye. He whimpers in distress and gropes in his suit pocket for a small bottle of bright green liquid, which he drops into his eye with a dropper. Another whimper of pain as the tentacle withdraws. He looks at his reflection. It seems normal. He puts his hat back on and leaves. INT. PARISIAN CAFÉ - EVENING 60 60 KAMA leaves the café. The feather points at him.

It is too badly hurt to keep running, but it is swiping at PASSERSBY, who are screaming and running out of the way. Cars screech to a halt.

JACOB is sagging under the weight of the unconscious KAMA. JACOB (calls) Newt, get out of there! NEWT stoops down slowly and opens his case. The Zouwu snarls, crouches, and begins to advance on NEWT. Very slowly, so as not to alarm the Zouwu, NEWT lowers his arm into the case, feeling for something. It takes him longer than he expected. Frowning, he reaches deeper inside. The Zouwu advances.

Bracing himself, he now does so: WE SEE: TEENAGE DUMBLEDORE and TEENAGE GRINDELWALD facing each other in a barn. Both score their palms with their wands. Now bleeding, they interlace their hands... DUMBLEDORE turns his head away, fighting the impulse to cover the glass again. Bracing himself, he looks up. From their bloody palms rise two glowing drops of blood, which mingle and merge to create one. A metal shape begins to form around the droplet, becoming more defined and intricate.

Nothing. For you? Everything I never had. But what is it you want, my boy? CREDENCE I want to know who I am. GRINDELWALD This is where you will find proof of your true identity. GRINDELWALD takes a piece of parchment from his pocket and throws it into the air. The parchment flutters to CREDENCE and lands gently in his hand. GRINDELWALD (CONT'D) Come to Père Lachaise tonight and you will discover the truth. He bows, then Disapparates, leaving CREDENCE holding a map of Père Lachaise cemetery. INT.

FLAMEL shuffles back into his studio and opens a cupboard. We glimpse glass vials, tubes, and the glowing Philosopher's Stone. He heaves from a shelf a padlocked book embossed with a phoenix. He touches the padlock and it springs open. CLOSE ON THE BOOK: as he flicks through it. Each page holds a photograph captioned with a name. FLAMEL turns the pages, but the subjects of all the pictures are missing. FLAMEL (CONT'D) Oh dear -- DUMBLEDORE'S portrait is blank.

He looks at her, eyes narrowed. She looks toward both THESEUS and NEWT, who are watching her, stunned. LETA I love you. She points her wand at the skull in ROSIER'S hands, which explodes. ROSIER is knocked backward and GRINDELWALD is momentarily obscured in a whirl of chaos. LETA (CONT'D) (to the others) GO! GO! The fire engulfs LETA. THESEUS goes wild. He tries to dive after her -- -- But NEWT grabs him and they Disapparate. The fire, mirroring GRINDELWALD'S rage, explodes, chasing them. GRINDELWALD (whispers) I hate Paris. EXT. PÈRE LACHAISE CEMETERY - A MINUTE LATER - NIGHT 115 115 NEWT and THESEUS, TINA with JACOB, and KAMA with NAGINI all Apparate out from the amphitheater. The black fire pursues them like a many- headed hydra, erupting out of every mausoleum. FLAMEL arrives at last. The cemetery is on the verge of destruction. The fire GRINDELWALD has unleashed is out of control. It forms dragon- like creatures intent on annihilation. FLAMEL TOGETHER! In a circle, your wand into the earth, or all Paris will be lost!

KAMA Finite! FLAMEL Finite! Our heroes, minus JACOB, make a circle, plunge their wands into the earth. It takes almost superhuman power to contain GRINDELWALD'S demonic fire, which they are forced to combat with flames still more deadly. United, our heroes fight... And at last, their purifying fire drives GRINDELWALD'S back. The entrances to the underground lair are sealed. They have saved the city. FLAMEL comforts JACOB. NAGINI sits in the darkness, tearful. NEWT shuffles over awkwardly to the bereft THESEUS. NEWT hesitates, struggling to find words of comfort. Then, for the first time in his life, he puts his arms around his brother. They hug.

NEWT It's a blood pact, isn't it? You swore not to fight each other. Bitterly ashamed, DUMBLEDORE nods. DUMBLEDORE (overcome) How in the name of Merlin did you manage to get... ? The Niffler pokes its head out of NEWT'S jacket, sad to see the pendant go. NEWT Grindelwald doesn't seem to understand the nature of things he considers simple.

And just as he has celebrated your torment, your brother seeks to destroy you. CREDENCE inhales sharply. His chick steps gingerly onto GRINDELWALD'S palm. GRINDELWALD throws it in the air, where it catches alight. GRINDELWALD (CONT'D) There is a legend in your family that a phoenix will come to any member who is in dire need.

We focus on a cobbled square outside the building shrouded in mist, eerie, silent. FIVE AURORS stand, wands aloft, tentative as they edge towards the chateau. A sudden explosion of pure white light sends them flying. WE WHIP ROUND: to find their bodies scattered, lying motionless at the entrance to a large parkland. A figure (GRINDELWALD) enters the frame, his back to the camera; ignoring the bodies, he stares out into the night sky, as we: PAN UP TOWARDS THE MOON. MONTAGE: WE SEE various magical newspaper headlines from 1926 relating to GRINDELWALD'S attacks all over the world: 'GRINDELWALD STRIKES AGAIN IN EUROPE', 'HOGWARTS SCHOOL INCREASES SECURITY', 'WHERE IS GRINDELWALD?'. He's a serious threat to the magical community and he's vanished. MOVING PHOTOS detail destroyed buildings, fires, screaming victims. The articles come thick and fast – the worldwide hunt for GRINDELWALD continues. WE PUSH IN: on a final article displaying the STATUE OF LIBERTY. TRANSITION TO: EXT. SHIP GLIDING INTO NEW YORK - NEXT MORNING 2 2 A bright, clear New York day. Seagulls swoop overhead. A large passenger ship glides past the Statue of Liberty.

PUSH IN: towards a figure sitting on a bench with his back to us – NEWT SCAMANDER, weather-beaten, wiry, wearing an old blue overcoat. Beside him rests a battered brown leather case. A catch on the case flicks open of its own accord. NEWT swiftly bends down to close it. Placing the case on his lap, NEWT leans in, whispering: NEWT Dougal – you settle down now, please. It won't be long. EXT. NEW YORK - DAY 3 3 AERIAL SHOT of New York. EXT. SHIP/INT.

NEWT places the case on the desk between them and discreetly flicks a brass dial to 'MUGGLEWORTHY'. The CUSTOMS OFFICIAL spins the case towards him and pops the catches, lifting the lid to reveal pyjamas, various maps, a journal, an alarm clock, a magnifying glass and a Hufflepuff scarf. Finally satisfied, he closes the case. CUSTOMS OFFICIAL (CONT'D) Welcome to New York. NEWT Thank you. NEWT gathers his passport and case. CUSTOMS OFFICIAL Next! NEWT exits through Customs. EXT. STREET NEAR CITY HALL SUBWAY - DUSK 5 5 A long street of identical brownstone houses, one of which has been reduced to rubble. A gaggle of reporters and photographers mills around in the vague hope of something happening, but without much enthusiasm. One REPORTER is interviewing an excitable middle-aged man as they move through the rubble. WITNESS -and it was like a – like a wind or like a – like a ghost – but dark – and I saw its eyes – shinin' white eyes-- CONTINUED: 4 4 (CONTINUED) Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 2015/08/18 3.

GRAVES: smart clothing, very handsome, early middle-age, his demeanour differs from those around him. He is watchful, tightly coiled, an air of intense confidence. PHOTOGRAPHER (sotto voce) Hey – did you get anything? REPORTER (sotto voce) Dark wind, blah blah. PHOTOGRAPHER It's some atmospheric hooey. Or electrical. GRAVES moves up the steps of the now-ruined building. He examines the destruction, curious, alert. REPORTER Hey – you thirsty? PHOTOGRAPHER Nah, I'm on the wagon. Promised Martha I'd lay off. The wind begins to pick up, swirling around the building, accompanied by a high-pitched screeching. GRAVES alone looks interested. A sudden series of bangs at street level. All turn to look for the source of the sound: a wall cracks, the rubble on the floor begins to shake before exploding like an earthquake, ripping out"

The mysterious force then flies up into the air, swirling through the city, diving in and out of alleyways, before crashing down into a subway station. CLOSE ON: GRAVES, as he examines the destruction of the street. A mingled roar and howl emanates from the bowels of the earth. EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY 6 6 WATCHING NEWT walk, we see in him an unselfconscious Keatonesque quality, a sense of a different rhythm to those around him. In his hand he clutches directions on a small piece of paper, but he still shows a scientist's curiosity about this alien environment. EXT. ANOTHER STREET, STEPS OF THE CITY BANK - DAY 7 7 NEWT, intrigued by the noise of shouting, approaches a rally of the NEW SALEM PHILANTHROPIC SOCIETY. MARY LOU BAREBONE, a handsome mid-western woman in a 1920s version of Puritan dress, charismatic and earnest, stands on a small stage at the steps to the City Bank. Behind her stands a man parading a banner emblazoned with the organisation's symbol: hands proudly grasping a broken wand amid bright yellow and red flames. MARY LOU (to the assembled crowd) ... this great city sparkles with the jewels of man's invention! Movie theatres, automobiles, the wireless, electric lights – all dazzle and bewitch us! NEWT slows down and watches MARY LOU as he would observe a foreign species: no judgement, simply interest. Nearby stands TINA GOLDSTEIN, hat low on her head, upturned collar. She is eating a hot dog, mustard smeared on her upper lip. NEWT accidently bumps into her as he makes his way to the front of the rally. NEWT Oh... so sorry.

JACOB KOWALSKI moves nervously down the street towards the crowd, wearing an ill-fitting suit and carrying a battered brown leather case. MARY LOU (O.S.)

(CONT'D) We have to fight together for the sake of our children – for the sake of tomorrow! (to NEWT) What do you say to that, friend? As NEWT looks up towards MARY LOU, something seen from the corner of his eye catches his attention: THE NIFFLER, a small furry black cross between a mole and a duck-billed platypus, is sitting on the steps of the bank, hastily pulling the beggar's hat full of money out of sight behind a pillar. NEWT, startled, looks down at his case. ANGLE ON: the Niffler, busy shovelling the beggar's coins into a pouch in its belly. The Niffler looks up, notices NEWT'S gaze, and hurriedly gathers the rest of the coins before tumbling away and into the bank.

LOBBY OF BANK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 8 8 A large, impressive-looking bank atrium. In the centre, behind a golden counter, clerks are busy at work serving customers. NEWT skids to a halt in the entrance of the space and looks around for his creature. His dress and demeanour make him out of place among the smartly dressed New Yorkers.

Well, may the best man win, I guess. NEWT spots the Niffler, which is now stealing coins from someone's bag. JACOB holds out his hand, but NEWT is off. NEWT Excuse me. NEWT darts away. In his place on the bench lies a large silver egg. JACOB Hey, mister... hey, mister! NEWT doesn't hear; he is too engaged in hunting the Niffler. JACOB picks up the egg just as the door into the BANK MANAGER'S office opens, and a SECRETARY looks out. JACOB (CONT'D) Hey, fella! SECRETARY Mr Kowalski, Mr Bingley will see you now. Pocketing the egg, JACOB heads towards the office, steeling himself. JACOB (sotto voce) Okay... okay. ANGLE ON: NEWT, surreptitiously pursuing the Niffler as it moves through the bank. He finally spots it removing a glittering buckle from a lady's shoe before scurrying onwards, eager for more shiny objects. As NEWT watches, helpless, the Niffler jumps lithely between cases and into bags, snatching and pilfering. CONTINUED: 8 8 Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 2015/08/18 9.

BINGLEY is examining JACOB'S business proposal for a bakery. An uncomfortable silence. The sound of a ticking clock and BINGLEY murmuring. JACOB looks down at his pocket – the egg has started to vibrate. BINGLEY You are currently working... in a canning factory? JACOB That's the best I can do – I only got back in '24. BINGLEY Got back?

CUT BACK TO: INT. BACK ROOM OF THE BANK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 10 10 NEWT IN THE BANK: in seeking the Niffler he has ended up waiting in line for a bank teller. He cranes his neck, peering towards the bag of a lady at the front of the line. TINA watches him from behind a pillar. ANGLE ON: coins spilling from underneath a bench. ANGLE ON: NEWT, who hears the coins and turns to see small paws hastily gathering them up. ANGLE ON: the Niffler sitting under the bench looking fat and smug. Not yet satisfied, its attention is caught by the shiny tag hanging around the neck of a small dog. The Niffler moves slowly, cheekily, forwards – little paw outstretched to grab the tag. The dog snarls and barks. NEWT starts forwards and dives under the bench – the Niffler runs, scuttling over the bank counter screens and out of NEWT'S reach.

NEWT gently takes the egg back from JACOB as it hatches, revealing a small blue, snake-like bird – an OCCAMY. NEWT, his face full of wonder, looks to JACOB as though expecting a similar reaction from him. Slowly, NEWT carries the baby creature down the stairs. JACOB Excuse me... JACOB, very confused, looks back up the stairs towards the main bank atrium. On seeing BINGLEY approaching, he ducks down the stairs, out of sight. JACOB (CONT'D) (to himself) I was – over there. I was – over there? Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 2015/08/18 12. (CONTINUED) Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 2015/08/18 13. INT. BASEMENT CORRIDOR OF BANK LEADING TO VAULT - DAY 15 15 JACOB'S POV: NEWT is crouched down, opening his case. He carefully places the hatched Occamy inside, whispering tenderly: NEWT In you hop... JACOB (O.S.) Hello? NEWT No. Everyone settle down – stay. Dougal, don't make me come in there... JACOB moves along the corridor, staring at NEWT. WE SEE a strange green creature, part stick insect, part plant, poke its head out of NEWT'S breast pocket, intrigued. This is PICKETT, a BOWTRUCKLE. NEWT (CONT'D) Don't make me come down there. NEWT looks up to see the Niffler squeezing itself through locked doors, into the central vault. NEWT (CONT'D) Absolutely not! NEWT takes out his wand and points it at the vault. NEWT (CONT'D) Alohomora. WE WATCH the locks and cogs of the vault door turn. BINGLEY comes round the corner, just as the vault door starts to open. BINGLEY (to JACOB) Oh, so you're gonna STEAL the money, huh? BINGLEY hits a button on the wall. An alarm sounds. NEWT aims his wand...

NEWT hurries into the vault. Inside he finds the Niffler lying among hundreds of opened deposit boxes, and seated on a great pile of cash. The Niffler stares at NEWT defiantly as it forces another gold bar into its already overflowing pouch. NEWT Really?! NEWT grasps the Niffler tightly and turns it upside down, shaking it by its hind legs. An extraordinary, and seemingly endless, number of precious items fall out. NEWT (CONT'D) (to the Niffler) No... JACOB looks around him in disbelief, an almost queasy fear. Despite their altercation, NEWT is fond of the Niffler. He grins as he tickles its stomach, causing more treasure to pour out. Footsteps on the stairs as several armed guards run down and into the vault corridor. JACOB (panicking) Oh no... no... don't shoot. Don't shoot!

Security alarms ring out from the bank and, at the end of the side street, WE SEE crowds gathering, police arriving. TINA runs out of the bank and looks down. She sees NEWT wrestling the Niffler back into the case, JACOB cowering by a wall. JACOB Ahhh! NEWT For the last time, you pilfering pest – paws off what doesn't belong to you! NEWT shuts his case, then looks around at JACOB. NEWT (CONT'D) I'm awfully sorry about all that - JACOB What the hell was that? NEWT Nothing that need concern you. Now unfortunately you have seen far too much, so if you wouldn't mind – if you just stand there – this will be over in a jiffy. NEWT, trying to find his wand, turns his back on JACOB. JACOB takes the opportunity, seizes his case, and swings it violently at NEWT, who is knocked to the ground. JACOB Sorry- JACOB runs for his life. NEWT holds his head for a moment and looks after JACOB, who has hurried down the alleyway and into the crowd. NEWT Bugger! TINA comes walking down the side street with purpose.

WOOLWORTH BUILDING RECEPTION - DAY 19 19 A normal 1920s office atrium, people milling around and chatting. TINA (O.S.) Hey. By the way, we closed that guy down a year ago. We don't allow the breeding of magical creatures in New York. PAN AROUND to watch TINA come through the door with NEWT. As they enter, the whole entrance magically transforms from the Woolworth Building to the Magical Congress of the United States of America (MACUSA). INT. MACUSA LOBBY - DAY 20 20 NEWT'S POV: as they move up a wide staircase and enter the main lobby – a vast, impressive space with impossibly high vaulted ceilings. High up, a gigantic dial with many cogs and faces emblazoned with the legend: MAGICAL EXPOSURE THREAT LEVEL. The hand on the dial points to SEVERE: UNEXPLAINED ACTIVITY. Behind hangs an imposing portrait of a majestic-looking witch: SERAPHINA PICQUERY, MACUSA's President. Owls circulate, witches and wizards in 1920s dress are hard at work. TINA guides an impressed-looking NEWT through the bustle. They pass several wizards sitting in a line, waiting to have their wands shined by a house-elf who operates a complex contraption of feathers. NEWT and TINA reach an elevator. The doors open to reveal RED, a goblin bellboy. RED Hey, Goldstein. TINA Hey, Red. TINA pushes NEWT inside. INT. ELEVATOR - DAY 21 21 TINA (to RED) Major Investigation Department.

No human could do what this thing is capable of, Madam President. MADAM PICQUERY (O.S.) Whatever it is, one thing's clear – it must be stopped. It's terrorising No-Majs, and when No- Majs are afraid, they attack. This could mean exposure. It could mean war.

Get out. TINA (humiliated) Yes, ma'am. TINA pushes a bemused-looking NEWT back towards the elevator. GRAVES looks after them, the only one to appear sympathetic. INT. BASEMENT - DAY 23 23 The elevator descends rapidly through the long shaft. The doors open onto a cramped, airless, windowless basement room. A painful contrast to the floor above. Clearly the place where utter no-hopers work. TINA leads NEWT past a hundred typewriters clacking away unmanned, with a tangle of glass pipes hanging down from the ceiling above them. As each memo or form is completed by a typewriter, it folds itself into an origami rat, which scurries up the appropriate tube to the offices above. Two rats collide and fight, tearing each other apart. TINA walks towards a dingy corner of the room. A sign: WAND PERMIT OFFICE. NEWT ducks under it. INT. WAND PERMIT OFFICE - DAY 24 24 The Wand Permit Office is only slightly larger than a cupboard. There are piles of unopened wand applications.

ABERNATHY (agitated by the lack of information) Have you been tracking them Second Salemers again? TINA Of course not, sir. GRAVES comes round the corner. ABERNATHY is immediately cowed. ABERNATHY Afternoon, Mr Graves, sir! GRAVES Afternoon, ah – Abernathy. TINA steps forwards to formally address GRAVES. TINA (speaking quickly, eager to have her case heard) Mr Graves, sir, this is Mr Scamander – he has a crazy creature in that case and it got out and caused mayhem in a bank, sir.

She looks aghast at the contents. ANGLE ON: the case contents – it is full of pastries. NEWT approaches, nervous. On seeing the contents he looks horrified. GRAVES looks confused, but smirks slightly: another one of TINA'S mistakes. GRAVES (CONT'D) Tina... GRAVES walks away. NEWT and TINA stare at each other. EXT.

He looks up at a portrait of his grandmother, which hangs on the wall. JACOB I'm sorry, Grandma. JACOB sits down at his desk, hanging his head in his hands, downcast, tired. Behind him, one of the catches on the case flies open. JACOB turns... He sits down on the bed and examines the case. The second catch now flicks open of its own accord, and the case begins to shake, emitting aggressive animalistic sounds. JACOB slowly backs away. Tentatively, he leans forward... suddenly the lid flies open and out bursts a MURTLAP – a rat-like creature with an anemone-style growth on its back. JACOB grapples with it, holding it tightly in both hands as it struggles. WE WHIP BACK to the case, which flies open once again as an INVISIBLE BEING shoots out, crashing into the ceiling before smashing through the window.

SECOND SALEM CHURCH, MAIN HALL - DAY - MONTAGE 27 27 A dingy wooden church with darkened windows and a high mezzanine balcony. MODESTY is playing a solitary variation of hopscotch, skipping in and out of a chalked grid. MODESTY My momma, your momma, gonna catch a witch My momma, your momma, flying on a switch My momma, your momma, witches never cry My momma, your momma, witches gonna die! As she sings we see the church is full of group paraphernalia – leaflets advertising MARY LOU'S campaign, and a large version of the group's anti- witchcraft banner. INT. SECOND SALEM CHURCH, MAIN HALL - DAY 28 28 A pigeon coos from a high-up window. CREDENCE steps forwards, staring up towards it before mechanically clapping his hands. The pigeon flies away.

Several of the children turn towards CHASTITY, who waits primly, handing out campaign leaflets. TIME CUT: MARY LOU and CREDENCE ladle out soup, CREDENCE looking intently into every face. A BOY with a birthmark on his face reaches the front of the line. CREDENCE stops his work and stares at him. MARY LOU reaches out to touch the BOY'S face. BOY Is it a witch's mark, ma'am? MARY LOU No. He's okay. The BOY takes his soup and leaves. CREDENCE stares after him, as they continue to serve. EXT.

NEWT Er – moth, I think. Big moth. TINA finds this explanation dubious. They round a corner to find a crowd gathered in front of a crumbling building. People are shouting, others are hurriedly evacuating the building. A POLICEMAN is standing at the centre of the crowd, being harassed by disgruntled tenement-dwellers. JUMP CUT: NEWT and TINA move around the outskirts of the crowd. At the back, a tipsy HOBO is trying to attract the POLICEMAN'S attention.

I can keep him if you want me to- TINA Oh, keep him? We don't keep them! Mr Scamander, do you know anything about the wizarding community in America? NEWT I do know a few things, actually. I know you have rather backwards laws about relations with non-magic people. That you're not meant to befriend them, that you can't marry them, which seems mildly absurd to me. JACOB is following this conversation, open-mouthed. TINA Who's going to marry him? You're both coming with me- NEWT I don't see why I need to come with you- TINA tries to lift the partially conscious JACOB from the floor. TINA Help me! NEWT feels obliged to help. JACOB I'm... I'm dreaming, right? Yeah... I'm tired, I never went to the bank. This is all just some big nightmare, right? TINA For the both of us, Mr Kowalski. TINA and NEWT Disapparate with JACOB.

UPPER EAST SIDE - AFTERNOON 36 36 A young boy, clutching a huge lollipop, is led down the busy street by his father. As they pass a fruit barrow, an apple suddenly levitates, bobbing along beside him. The boy gazes in wonder as the apple is eaten by something invisible, then the smile fades as his lollipop is snatched by the same unseen hands. AT A NEWSSTAND: the eyes of a lady on an advertisement blink open. The outline of a creature becomes visible, camouflage- like, before it peels away from the poster. It moves along the street, invisible again, only locatable by the lollipop it holds – seemingly suspended in mid-air. A dog barks in its direction, and the creature scuttles on, knocking over newspaper stands, causing bikes and cars to swerve. ANGLE ON: the roof of a department store – we see a thin blue tail slither inside a small attic window. Suddenly the building shakes and tiles break away, as the creature's size expands to fill the whole room. INT. SHAW TOWER NEWSROOM - DUSK 37 37 The glittering Art Deco headquarters of a media empire. Many journalists are hard at work in an outer office. An elevator opens and LANGDON SHAW bustles excitedly through the room, leading the SECOND SALEMERS. He carries maps, several old books and a handful of photographs. MARY LOU is composed, CHASTITY looks shy and MODESTY is excited, curious. CREDENCE looks nervous – he doesn't like crowds. LANGDON ... and so this is the newsroom. LANGDON spins around excitedly, eager to show the SECOND SALEMERS that he holds authority here. LANGDON (CONT'D) Let's go!

LANGDON (CONT'D) Hey, how are you? Make way for the Barebones! Now, they're just putting the papers to bed, as they say. Looks of veiled amusement from journalists as LANGDON leads his group to double doors at the end of the open-plan area. HENRY SHAW SR'S assistant – BARKER – stands up, anxious. BARKER Mr Shaw, sir, he's with the senator- LANGDON Never mind that, Barker, I wanna see my father! LANGDON pushes past. INT. SHAW SR'S PENTHOUSE OFFICE - DUSK 38 38 A large, impressive office with spectacular views across the city. The newspaper magnate – HENRY SHAW SR – is talking to his elder son, SENATOR SHAW.

LANGDON This is Mary Lou Barebone from the New Salem Philanthropic Society, and she's got a big story for you! SHAW SR Oh she has – has she? LANGDON There's strange things going on all over the city. The people behind this – they are not like you and me. This is witchcraft, don't you see? SHAW SR and the SENATOR look dubious – all too used to LANGDON'S harebrained little projects and interests. SHAW SR Langdon. LANGDON She doesn't want any money. SHAW SR Then either her story is worthless, or she's lying about the cost. Nobody gives away anything valuable for free. MARY LOU (confident, persuasive) You are right, Mr Shaw. What we desire is infinitely more valuable than money: it's your influence. Millions of people read your newspapers and they need to be made aware about this danger. LANGDON The crazy disturbances in the subway – just look at the pictures!

BROWNSTONE STREET - SHORTLY AFTERWARDS - DUSK 39 39 TINA and NEWT stand on either side of an ailing JACOB, trying to keep him steady. TINA Take a right here... JACOB makes various retching sounds, the bite on his neck clearly affecting him more and more. As the group rounds a corner, TINA hurries them to hide behind a large repair truck. From here she peers at a house across the street. TINA (CONT'D) Okay – before we go in – I'm not supposed to have men on the premises. NEWT In that case, Mr Kowalski and I can easily seek other accommodation- TINA Oh no, you don't! TINA quickly grabs JACOB'S arm and pulls him across the road, NEWT dutifully following.

GOLDSTEIN RESIDENCE, SITTING ROOM - DUSK 41 41 The group enters the Goldstein apartment. Although impoverished, the apartment is enlivened by workaday magic. An iron is working away on its own in a corner, and a clothes horse revolves clumsily on its wooden legs in front of the fire, drying an assortment of underwear. Magazines are scattered around: THE WITCH'S FRIEND, WITCH CHAT and TRANSFIGURATION TODAY. Blonde QUEENIE, the most beautiful girl ever to don witches' robes, is standing in a silk slip, supervising the mending of a dress on a dressmaker's dummy. JACOB is thunderstruck. NEWT barely notices. Impatient to leave as soon as possible, he starts peeking out of the windows. QUEENIE Teenie – you brought men home? TINA Gentlemen, this is my sister.

QUEENIE playfully gestures towards JACOB with her wand. QUEENIE (CONT'D) Now, you need food. NEWT looks out the window and sees a Billywig fly past – he's nervous, impatient to get out and find his creatures. TINA and QUEENIE busy themselves in the kitchen. Ingredients come floating out of cupboards as QUEENIE enchants them into the components of a meal – carrots and apples chop themselves, pastry rolls itself and pans stir. QUEENIE (CONT'D) (to TINA) Hot dog... again? TINA Don't read my mind! QUEENIE Not a very wholesome lunch. TINA points her wand at the cupboards. Dishes, assorted cutlery and glasses come flying out, setting themselves on the table with a little prodding from TINA'S wand. JACOB, half-fascinated, half-terrified, staggers towards the table.

TINA stares at NEWT: confrontational, but also disappointed and hurt. JACOB is already seated at the table, tucking his napkin into his shirt. QUEENIE (reading JACOB'S mind) You prefer strudel, huh, honey? Strudel it is. JACOB nods with excited enthusiasm. QUEENIE grins back, delighted. With a flick of her wand, QUEENIE sends raisins, apples and pastry flying into the air. The concoction neatly wraps itself up into a cylindrical pie, baking on the spot, complete with ornate decoration and a dusting of sugar. JACOB takes a deep breath in: heaven. TINA lights candles on the table – the meal is ready. FOCUS ON: NEWT'S pocket, a small squeak, and PICKETT pokes his head out, curious. TINA Well, sit down, Mr Scamander, we're not going to poison you. NEWT, still hovering near the door, looks somewhat charmed by the situation. JACOB glares at him subtly, willing him to sit down. EXT. BROADWAY - NIGHT 42 42 CREDENCE is walking alone through a worldly crowd of late- night diners and theatre-goers. Traffic roars past. He is trying to give out leaflets but is met with only incredulity and faint derision. The Woolworth Building looms ahead. CREDENCE glances towards it with a hint of longing. GRAVES stands outside, watching CREDENCE intently. CREDENCE spots him, hope flickering across his face. Utterly enthralled, CREDENCE moves across the street towards GRAVES, barely looking where he's going – everything else is forgotten.

Somebody's said something – what did they say? Tell me. CREDENCE Do you think I'm a freak? GRAVES No – I think you're a very special young man or I wouldn't have asked you to help me, now would I? A pause. GRAVES rests a hand on CREDENCE'S arm. The human contact seems to both startle and captivate CREDENCE. GRAVES (CONT'D) Have you any news? CREDENCE I'm still looking. Mr Graves, if I knew whether it was a girl or boy- GRAVES My vision showed only the child's immense power. He or she is no older than ten, and I saw this child in close proximity to your mother – she I saw so plainly. CREDENCE That could be any one"

He and QUEENIE are getting on famously. QUEENIE The job ain't that glamorous. I mean, I spend most days making coffee, unjinxing the john... Tina's the career girl. (she reads his mind) Nah. We're orphans. Ma and Pa died of dragon pox when we were kids. Aww... (reading his mind) You're sweet. But we got each other! JACOB Could you stop reading my mind for a second? Don't get me wrong – I love it. QUEENIE giggles, delighted, captivated by JACOB. JACOB (CONT'D) This meal – it's insanely good! This is what I do – I'm a cook and this is, like, the greatest meal I have ever had in my life. QUEENIE (laughing) Oh you slay me! I ain't never really talked to a No-Maj before. JACOB Really?

The moment the door closes NEWT jumps up, still wearing his overcoat, and places his case on the floor. To JACOB'S utter astonishment, NEWT opens the case and walks down inside it, now completely out of sight. JACOB lets out a small scream of alarm. NEWT'S hand appears from the case, beckoning him imperiously. JACOB stares, breathing heavily, trying to process the situation. NEWT'S hand, impatient, appears again. NEWT (O.S.) Come on. JACOB rallies himself, gets out of bed and steps down into NEWT'S case. However, he gets stuck at his waistline and tries hard to squeeze himself through, the case bouncing up and down with his efforts. JACOB For the love of...

So our physiologies are subtly different. NEWT busies himself at his work station, using plants and the contents of various bottles to create a poultice, which he rapidly applies to JACOB'S neck.

NEWT doesn't notice, his attention now focused on a spiny cocoon, which he slowly begins to squeeze. As he does so, the cocoon emits a luminous venom, which NEWT collects into a glass vial. NEWT (CONT'D) (to the cocoon) Come on... JACOB What you got there? NEWT Well this – the locals call 'Swooping Evil' – not the friendliest of names. It's quite an agile fellow. As if to demonstrate, NEWT flicks the cocoon, which unravels, dangling elegantly from his finger. NEWT (CONT'D) I've been studying him. And I am pretty sure his venom could be quite useful if properly diluted. Just to remove bad memories, you know. Quite suddenly NEWT throws the Swooping Evil towards JACOB. The creature bursts out from its cocoon – a bat-like, spikey and colourful creature – which howls in JACOB'S face before NEWT recalls it. JACOB recoils dramatically, but this was evidently NEWT'S idea of a little joke... NEWT (CONT'D) (smiling to himself) Probably shouldn't let him loose in here, though.

It contains what appears to be a safari park in miniature. Each of NEWT'S creatures has its own perfect, magically realised, habitat. JACOB steps into this world, totally amazed. NEWT is standing in the nearest habitat – a slice of Arizona desert. This area contains FRANK, a magnificent Thunderbird – a creature like a large albatross, his glorious wings shimmering with cloud- and sun-like patterns. One of his legs is rubbed raw and bloody – he has obviously previously been chained. As FRANK flaps his wings, his habitat fills with a torrential downpour, thunder and lightning. NEWT uses his wand to create a magical umbrella, shielding him from the rain. NEWT (eyes on FRANK up high) Come on.... come on... down you come... come on. Slowly FRANK calms himself, lowering down to stand on a large rock in front of NEWT. As he does, the rain dies down and is replaced by a brilliant, hot sunshine. NEWT puts his wand away and produces a handful of grubs from his pocket. FRANK watches intently. NEWT strokes FRANK with his free hand, calming him, affectionate. NEWT (CONT'D) Oh, thank Paracelsus. If you'd have got out that could have been quite catastrophic. (to JACOB) You see, he's the real reason I came to America. To bring Frank home. JACOB, still staring, steps slowly forwards.

(to FRANK, calming) Here you are – here you are. (to JACOB) He was trafficked, you see. I found him in Egypt, he was all chained up. Couldn't leave him there, had to bring him back. I'm going to put you back where you belong, aren't I, Frank. To the wilds of Arizona. NEWT, his face full of hope and expectation, hugs FRANK'S head. Then, grinning, he casts the handful of grubs high into the air. FRANK soars majestically upwards after them, sunlight bursting from his wings. NEWT watches him fly with love and pride. Then he turns, puts his hands to his mouth, and roars beast-like towards another area of the case. NEWT moves past JACOB, grabbing the bucket of meat.

JACOB hurries towards the sound, finding NEWT in a sandy, moonlit territory. NEWT (CONT'D) (under his breath) Ah – here they come. JACOB Here who comes? NEWT The Graphorns. A large creature comes charging INTO SIGHT: a GRAPHORN – built like a sabre- toothed tiger but with slimy tentacles at its mouth. JACOB screams and tries to back off, but NEWT grabs hold of his arm, stopping him. NEWT (CONT'D) You're all right. You're all right. The Graphorn moves closer to NEWT.

If I hadn't managed to rescue them, that could have been the end of Graphorns – for ever. A younger Graphorn trots straight up to JACOB and begins licking his hand, circling him curiously. He stares down at it, then gently reaches out and strokes its head. NEWT watches JACOB, pleased. NEWT (CONT'D) All right. NEWT throws a piece of meat into the enclosure, which is hastily chased and consumed by the young Graphorn. JACOB So what – you, you rescue these creatures? NEWT Yes, that's right. Rescue, nurture and protect them, and I'm gently trying to educate my fellow wizards about them. A tiny bright pink bird, the FWOOPER, flies past and comes to rest on a little perch, suspended from mid-air. NEWT heads up a small ramp of stairs. NEWT (CONT'D) (to JACOB) Come on. They enter a bamboo wood, ducking and diving through the trees. NEWT calls out. NEWT (CONT'D) Titus? Finn? Poppy, Marlow, Tom?

They learn to defend themselves early. See, their shells are made of silver so they're incredibly valuable. NEWT feeds the other babies in the nest. JACOB Okay...

They swarm upwards, mingling with Doxys, Glow Bugs and Grindylows which float through the air. THE CAMERA PANS UP to reveal another magnificent creature, the NUNDU – looking almost exactly like a lion, it has a large mane which bursts forth when it roars.

Oh, hello fellas – all right – all right. The Mooncalves jump and hop down the rocks towards JACOB, who finds himself suddenly surrounded by their friendly, hopeful faces. JACOB (CONT'D) Take it easy – take it easy. As he throws pellets, the Mooncalves bob eagerly up and down. JACOB visibly seems to be feeling better – he really likes this... ANGLE ON: NEWT, now cradling a luminescent creature with sprouting alien-like tendrils. He feeds the creature with a bottle, while carefully watching how JACOB handles the Mooncalves – he recognises a kindred spirit. JACOB (CONT'D) (still feeding the Mooncalves) There you go, cutie. Ah, there it is. A kind of icy cry echoes from nearby. JACOB (CONT'D) (towards NEWT) Did you hear that? But NEWT is gone.

His eyes move downwards: DIAMONDS ARE SCATTERED ACROSS THE PAVEMENT, leading towards the window of one particular diamond shop. NEWT stealthily follows the trail, creeping past shop windows. Something catches his eye and suddenly he pauses. Very slowly, he tiptoes backwards. The Niffler is standing in a shop window. In order to hide, it is emulating a jewellery stand, little arms outstretched, covered in diamonds. NEWT stares at the Niffler in disbelief. Sensing NEWT'S stare, the Niffler slowly turns.

JACOB stares down the street, incredulous as he watches NEWT who, from an outsider's perspective, appears to be looting the diamond shop. The Niffler appears, scurrying over NEWT'S shoulders in an attempt to get higher and away from his clutches. NEWT jumps onto a desk after him, but the Niffler is now balancing on a crystal chandelier. NEWT reaches out and trips, both he and the Niffler now hanging from the chandelier as it swings wildly round and round. JACOB looks around the street nervously, checking if anyone else can hear the chaos coming from within the shop. Finally the chandelier crashes to the floor, smashing. Straight away the Niffler is back up, clambering across cases full of jewellery, NEWT in hot pursuit. A catch opens on NEWT'S case and a roar comes from within. JACOB fearfully looks towards the case. The Niffler and NEWT continue their chase, finally climbing onto a jewellery case that can't take their weight. The case, with them both on top, falls to rest against one of the shop windows. Both NEWT and the Niffler become very still... JACOB breathes deeply and slowly moves forward to close the latch on the case. Suddenly a crack appears on the window. NEWT watches as the crack spreads across the pane of glass and the window bursts open, shattering across the pavement – NEWT and the Niffler crashing to the ground. The Niffler is still only for a moment before running off down the street. NEWT quickly gathers himself, drawing his wand. NEWT (CONT'D) ACCIO!

TIME CUT: NEWT places his case down on the ground near the Erumpent and slowly, seductively, opens it.

They face each other, circle round, undulating weirdly. The Erumpent's demeanour is puppy-like, her horn glowing orange. NEWT rolls along the floor – the Erumpent copies, moving nearer and nearer to the open case. NEWT (CONT'D) Good girl – come on – into the case... JACOB takes a sniff of the Erumpent musk.

JACOB Call me Jacob. They shake hands. THIRD PERSON POV: someone watches as NEWT hauls JACOB up and they slip and slide across the frozen lake as fast as they can. NEWT Well, two down, one to go. HOLD ON: TINA as she hides on the bridge above them, peeking down. NEWT (O.S.) (CONT'D) (to JACOB) In you hop. We see the case sitting alone below the bridge. TINA quickly appears around the corner and hurriedly sits on the case. She closes the catches, looking shocked but determined. ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Ladies and gentlemen... INT. CITY HALL - NIGHT 55 55 A large, ornately decorated hall, covered in patriotic emblems. Hundreds of glamorously dressed people sit at round tables, looking towards a stage at the far end. Over this stage hangs a large poster of SENATOR SHAW with a slogan reading 'AMERICA'S FUTURE'. An ANNOUNCER stands behind the microphone.

He's been mentioned as a future President – and if you don't believe me, just read his daddy's newspapers- Indulgent laughter from the crowd. WE SEE SHAW SR and LANGDON seated at a table, surrounded by the crème de la crème of New York society. ANNOUNCER (CONT'D) -ladies and gentlemen, I give you the Senator for New York, Henry Shaw! Tumultuous applause. SENATOR SHAW bounds forwards, acknowledging the cheers, pointing and winking at intimates in the crowd, and mounts the steps. EXT. DARK STREET - NIGHT 56 56 Something is streaking through the streets, too large and fast for a human. Strange, laboured breathing and snarling – it is inhuman, beast-like. EXT. STREET NEAR CITY HALL - NIGHT 57 57 TINA is hurrying along, clutching the case. Street lights start going out around her. She stops, feels something pass in the darkness – turns, staring, scared. INT. CITY HALL - NIGHT 58 58 SENATOR SHAW ... and it's true we have made some progress, but there is no reward for idleness. So just as the odious saloons have been banished... A strange, haunting noise comes from the organ pipes at the back of the room. Everyone turns to look, the SENATOR pauses.

SENATOR SHAW (CONT'D) ...so now the pool halls, and these private parlours... The strange noise gets louder. Guests turn to look again. The SENATOR seems anxious. People mutter. Suddenly something explodes forth from underneath the organ. Something huge and bestial, although invisible, is soaring down the hall – tables fly, people are thrown, lights smash and people scream as it carves a line towards the stage. SENATOR SHAW is thrown backwards against his own poster, raised up high and suspended for a moment in mid-air before being brought down with a violent crash – DEAD. The 'beast' rips at his poster – a frenzied slashing with harsh, noisy breathing – before swarming back out from where it came. Sounds of anguish and panic from the crowd as SHAW SR fights through the debris towards his son's torn and bleeding body. ANGLE ON: SENATOR SHAW'S body, his face brutally scarred. SHAW SR looks devastated as he crouches beside his son. ANGLE ON: LANGDON, now on his feet, slightly drunk. Determined, perhaps triumphant. LANGDON WITCHES! INT. MACUSA LOBBY - NIGHT 59 59 FOCUS ON the gigantic dial showing the MAGICAL EXPOSURE THREAT LEVEL. The hand moves from SEVERE to EMERGENCY.

Every seat is occupied by wizards from all parts of the world. MADAM PICQUERY is presiding, GRAVES at her side. The Swiss delegate is speaking. HEINRICH EBERSTADT ... that threatens to expose us all. MADAM PICQUERY I will not be lectured by the man who let Gellert Grindelwald slip through his fingers- A hologram image of SENATOR SHAW'S dead and twisted body floats high above the room, emitting a glowing light. All heads turn as TINA hurries into the chamber. TINA Madam President, I'm so sorry to interrupt, but this is critical- Echoing silence. TINA slides to a halt in the middle of the marble floor before realising exactly what she's walked into. The delegates stare at her. MADAM PICQUERY You'd better have an excellent excuse for this intrusion, Miss Goldstein. TINA Yes – I do. (stepping forwards to address her) Ma'am. Yesterday a wizard entered New York with a case. This case of magical creatures, and – unfortunately – some have escaped. MADAM PICQUERY He arrived yesterday? You have known for twenty-four hours that an unregistered wizard set magical beasts loose in New York and you see fit to tell us only when a man has been killed?"

First NEWT, then JACOB emerge, looking sheepish and nervous. BRITISH ENVOY Scamander? NEWT (closing the case) Oh – er – hello, Minister. MOMOLU WOTORSON Theseus Scamander? The war hero? BRITISH ENVOY No, this is his little brother. And what in the name of Merlin are you doing in New York? NEWT I came to buy an Appaloosa Puffskein, sir. BRITISH ENVOY (suspicious) Right. What are you really doing here? MADAM PICQUERY (to TINA, about JACOB) Goldstein – and who is this? TINA This is Jacob Kowalski, Madam President, he's a No-Maj who got bitten by one of Mr Scamander's creatures. Furious reaction from the MACUSA employees and dignitaries all around. MINISTERS (whispers) No-Maj? Obliviated? NEWT is absorbed in the image of SENATOR SHAW'S body floating around the room.

ANGLE ON: SENATOR SHAW'S face. ANGLE ON: NEWT. NEWT (CONT'D) That was an Obscurus. Mass consternation, muttering, exclamations. GRAVES looks alert. MADAM PICQUERY You go too far, Mr Scamander. There is no Obscurial in America. Impound that case, Graves! GRAVES summons the case; it lands next to him. NEWT draws his wand. NEWT (to GRAVES) No... give that b--! MADAM PICQUERY (CONT'D) Arrest them! A dazzling eruption of spells hit NEWT, TINA and JACOB, all of whom are slammed to their knees. NEWT'S wand flies out of his hand, caught by GRAVES. GRAVES stands and picks up the case. NEWT (CONT'D) (magically restrained) No – no – don't hurt those creatures – please, you don't understand – nothing in there is dangerous, nothing!

MACUSA CELL - DAY 61 61 NEWT, TINA and JACOB sitting, NEWT with his head in his hands, still in utter despair about his creatures. Finally TINA, on the verge of tears, breaks the silence. TINA I am so sorry about your creatures, Mr Scamander. I truly am. NEWT remains silent. JACOB (sotto voce, to TINA) Can someone please tell me what this Obscurial Obscurius thing is? Please? TINA (also sotto voce) There hasn't been one for centuries- NEWT I met one in Sudan three months ago. There used to be more of them but they still exist. Before wizards went underground, when we were still being hunted by Muggles, young wizards and witches sometimes tried to suppress their magic to avoid persecution. Instead of learning to harness or to control their powers, they developed what was called an Obscurus.

TINA (off JACOB'S confusion) It's an unstable, uncontrollable dark force that busts out and – and attacks... and then vanishes... As she talks, we see the penny dropping. An Obscurus fits everything she knows about the perpetrator of the New York attacks. TINA (CONT'D) (to NEWT) Obscurials can't survive long, can they? NEWT There's no documented case of any Obscurial surviving past the age of ten. The one I met in Africa was eight when she – she was eight when she died. JACOB What are you telling me here – that Senator Shaw was killed by a – by a kid? NEWT'S look says 'yes'. INT. SECOND SALEM CHURCH, MAIN HALL - DAY - MONTAGE 62 62 MODESTY approaches the long table at which many orphan children sit hungrily eating.

NEWT (over his shoulder) It was good to make your acquaintance, Jacob, and I hope you get your bakery. ANGLE ON: JACOB, scared, left behind, clutching at the bars of the cell. He waves forlornly after NEWT. INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 65 65 A small, bare room, black-walled and windowless. GRAVES sits opposite NEWT at an interrogation desk, a file open in front of him.

TINA (stepping forwards) Mr Graves- GRAVES holds a finger to his lips, signalling for TINA to be silent. The gesture is patronising, but authoritative. TINA looks kowtowed – she obeys, stepping back into the shadows. GRAVES examines the file on his desk. GRAVES You were thrown out of Hogwarts for endangering human life-- NEWT That was an accident! GRAVES (CONT'D) --with a beast. Yet one of your teachers argued strongly against your expulsion. Now, what makes Albus Dumbledore so fond of you? NEWT I really couldn't say. GRAVES So setting a pack of dangerous creatures loose here was just another accident, is that right? NEWT Why would I do it deliberately? GRAVES To expose wizardkind. To provoke war between the magical and non- magical worlds. NEWT Mass slaughter for the greater good, you mean? GRAVES Yes. Quite.

He brings it onto the desk – it is pulsing, swirling and hissing. CLOSE ON: TINA as she stares, disbelieving. GRAVES reaches a hand towards the Obscurus – he's utterly fascinated. At his sudden close proximity, the Obscurus swirls faster, bubbling and shrinking backwards. NEWT turns instinctively to TINA. Without fully realising why, it is she whom he wants to convince. NEWT It's an Obscurus- (off her look) But, it's not what you think. I managed to separate it from the Sudanese girl as I tried to save her – I wanted to take it home, to study it- (off TINA'S shock) But it cannot survive outside that box, it could not hurt anyone, Tina! GRAVES So it's useless without the host? NEWT 'Useless? Useless?' That is a parasitical magical force that killed a child. What on earth would you use it for?

GRAVES (CONT'D) --you are therefore guilty of a treasonous betrayal of your fellow wizards and are sentenced to death. Miss Goldstein, who has aided and abetted you- NEWT (CONT'D) No, she's done nothing of the kind-- GRAVES (CONT'D) --she receives the same sentence. The two EXECUTIONERS step forward. They calmly, intrusively, press the tips of their wands into NEWT and TINA'S necks. TINA is so overcome with shock and fear that she can barely speak. GRAVES (CONT'D) (to the EXECUTIONERS) Just do it immediately. I will inform President Picquery myself. NEWT Tina. GRAVES again places a finger to his lips. GRAVES Shhhh.

NEWT and TINA are forced into this room by the EXECUTIONERS. A guard stands at the door. TINA (to EXECUTIONER 1) Don't do this – Bernadette – please- EXECUTIONER 1 It don't hurt. TINA is led to the edge of the pool. She begins panicking, her breathing heavy and erratic. The smiling EXECUTIONER 1 raises a wand and carefully extracts TINA'S happy memories from her head. TINA instantly calms – her expression now vacant, other-worldly. EXECUTIONER 1 casts the memories into the potion, which ripples, coming alive with scenes from TINA'S life. A young TINA smiles up as her mother calls. TINA'S MOTHER (V.O.) Tina... Tina... come on, pumpkin – time for bed. Are you ready? TINA Momma... TINA'S MOTHER appears in the pool, her expression loving and warm. The real TINA watches, smiling down. EXECUTIONER 1 Don't that look good. You wanna get in? Huh? TINA nods vacantly.

She finds MARY LOU, standing over CREDENCE, belt in hand – CREDENCE looks terrified. In anger, TINA casts a spell, striking MARY LOU. TINA moves forward to comfort CREDENCE. TINA It's okay.

EXECUTIONER 2 (to NEWT) Okay, let's get the good stuff out of you- EXECUTIONER 2 raises her wand to NEWT'S forehead. NEWT seizes his opportunity – he jumps backwards out of the way before revealing: the SWOOPING EVIL, which he throws forwards towards the pool. He then swiftly turns and punches the guard, knocking him out cold. The SWOOPING EVIL has now expanded into a gigantic, spooky but weirdly beautiful butterfly-esque reptile with skeletal wings. It continues to circle round and round the pool. PICKETT clambers onto EXECUTIONER 2'S arm and bites, startling and distracting her, giving NEWT time to grab her arms and take aim with her wand. A spell fires, hitting EXECUTIONER 1, who drops to the floor, her wand falling into the pool. As it falls, the liquid rises up in viscous black bubbles, instantly engulfing the wand. In reaction, TINA'S memories turn from good to bad: WE SEE MARY LOU, pointing aggressively at TINA. MARY LOU Witch!

She tries desperately to regain her balance. NEWT DON'T PANIC! TINA WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST I DO INSTEAD? NEWT makes a strange tutting sound, commanding the SWOOPING EVIL to circle the pool once more.

Suddenly accosted by the group of Aurors, they turn, darting behind pillars, just missing the fired curses and spells. NEWT again sends out the SWOOPING EVIL, which swirls overhead, flying in and out of pillars, blocking curses and knocking Aurors to the ground. ANGLE ON: the SWOOPING EVIL using its proboscis to probe in one of the Auror's ears. NEWT (making a clicking sound) LEAVE HIS BRAINS. Come on! Come on! TINA and NEWT run onwards, the SWOOPING EVIL flying after, blocking curses as it goes. TINA What is that thing? NEWT Swooping Evil. TINA Well, I love it! ANGLE ON: QUEENIE and JACOB, walking briskly through the basement. NEWT and TINA sprint round the corner and almost collide with them. The four stare at one another, panic on all their faces. Finally QUEENIE gestures to the case. QUEENIE Get in! INT. STAIRS LEADING TO CELLS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 77 77 GRAVES moves down the stairs with urgency. For the first time, a look of panic on his face. INT. MACUSA LOBBY - MINUTES LATER - DAY 78 78 QUEENIE moves quickly across the lobby floor, trying desperately not to be conspicuous in her haste, but acutely aware of the need to leave. A flustered ABERNATHY emerges from a crowd of wizards. ABERNATHY Queenie! CONTINUED: 76 76 (CONTINUED) Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 2015/08/18 83.

ABERNATHY moves towards her, straightening his tie, trying to appear calm and authoritative – QUEENIE obviously makes him nervous. ABERNATHY (CONT'D) (a large smile) Where you going? QUEENIE puts on an alluringly innocent expression and holds the case behind her back. QUEENIE I'm... I'm sick, Mr Abernathy. She coughs a little, widening her eyes. ABERNATHY Again? Well – what've you got there? A beat. QUEENIE thinks fast, her face quickly breaking into a breathtaking smile. QUEENIE Ladies' things. QUEENIE produces the case and innocently trots up the steps towards ABERNATHY. QUEENIE (CONT'D) You wanna take a look? I don't mind. ABERNATHY is overcome with embarrassment. ABERNATHY (swallowing hard) Oh! Good gravy, no! I – you get well now! QUEENIE (smiling sweetly and arranging his tie) Thanks!

STREETS OF NEW YORK - LATE AFTERNOON 79 79 HIGH WIDE: above New York. WE ZOOM over rooftops before DIVING DOWN through streets and alleyways, past speeding cars and cackling children. WE COME TO REST in an alleyway at the Second Salem Church, where CREDENCE is pasting up posters advertising MARY LOU'S next meeting. GRAVES Apparates in the alleyway. CREDENCE, startled, backs away, but GRAVES makes straight for him, his tone and manner urgent, forceful. GRAVES Credence. Have you found the child? CREDENCE I can't. GRAVES, impatient but feigning calm, holds out his hand – suddenly seeming caring, affectionate. GRAVES Show me. CREDENCE whimpers and cowers, almost backing further away. GRAVES gently takes CREDENCE'S hand in his own and examines it – the hand is covered in deep red cuts, sore and bleeding. GRAVES (CONT'D) Shhhh. My boy, the sooner we find this child, the sooner you can put that pain in the past where it belongs. GRAVES gently, almost seductively, moves his thumb across the cuts, healing them instantly. CREDENCE stares. GRAVES seems to make a decision. He puts on an earnest, trustworthy expression as, from his pocket, he produces a chain bearing the symbol of the Deathly Hallows. GRAVES (CONT'D) I want you to have this, Credence. I would trust very few with it- GRAVES moves close, placing the chain around CREDENCE'S neck as he whispers.

GRAVES (CONT'D) Very few. GRAVES places his hands on either side of CREDENCE'S neck, drawing him in, his speech quiet, intimate. GRAVES (CONT'D) ... but you – you're different. CREDENCE is unsure, both nervous of and attracted by GRAVES'S behaviour. GRAVES rests his hand on CREDENCE'S heart, covering the pendant. GRAVES (CONT'D) Now, when you find the child, touch this symbol and I will know, and I will come to you. GRAVES moves even closer to CREDENCE, his face inches from the boy's neck – the effect is both alluring and threatening – as he whispers. GRAVES (CONT'D) Do this and you will be honoured among wizards. For ever. GRAVES pulls CREDENCE into a hug which, with his hand on CREDENCE'S neck, seems more controlling than affectionate. CREDENCE, overwhelmed by the seeming affection, closes his eyes and relaxes slightly. GRAVES slowly backs away, stroking CREDENCE'S neck. CREDENCE keeps his eyes closed, longing for the human contact to continue. GRAVES (CONT'D) (whispers) The child is dying, Credence. Time is running out.

PICKETT sits on his shoulder, clicking. JACOB is inside the shed, looking at the pigeon coop as QUEENIE enters. QUEENIE Your grandfather kept pigeons? Mine bred owls. I used to love feeding 'em. ANGLE ON: NEWT and TINA – TINA has joined NEWT in standing on the ledge. TINA Graves always insisted the disturbances were caused by a beast. We need to catch all your creatures, so he can't keep using them as a scapegoat. NEWT There's only one still missing. Dougal, my Demiguise. TINA Dougal? NEWT Slight problem is that... um, he's invisible. TINA (this is so ridiculous that she can't help but smile) Invisible? NEWT Yes – most of the time... he does... um...

They smile at each other – there's a new warmth between them, NEWT still awkward but somehow unable to stop staring at TINA as she smiles. TINA moves slowly towards NEWT. A beat. TINA (CONT'D) Gnarlak! NEWT (taken aback) Excuse me? TINA (conspiratorial, excited) Gnarlak - he was an informant of mine when I was an Auror! He used to trade in magical creatures on the side- NEWT He wouldn't happen to have an interest in paw prints, would he? TINA He's interested in anything he can sell. EXT. THE BLIND PIG - NIGHT 81 81 TINA leads the group down an insalubrious back alley covered in bins, crates and discarded objects. She locates a set of steps leading to a basement apartment and motions them down. The steps appear to lead to a dead end: THE DOORWAY HAS BEEN BRICKED UP. Instead, a poster of a simpering debutante in evening dress, gazing at herself in a mirror, covers the end of the walkway. TINA and QUEENIE stand in front of this poster. They turn to each other and, in unison, raise their wands. As they do so, their work clothes transform into stunning flapper party dresses.

JACOB looks on, jealously. A HATCH OPENS: the painted eyes of the debutante whip back to reveal the gaze of a suspicious guard. INT. THE BLIND PIG - NIGHT 82 82 A seedy, low-ceilinged speakeasy for the down and out of New York's magical community. Every witch and wizard criminal in New York is here, their wanted posters hanging proudly on the walls. A glimpse of 'GELLERT GRINDELWALD: WANTED FOR NO-MAJ SLAYINGS IN EUROPE'. A glamorous goblin JAZZ SINGER croons on a stage full of goblin musicians, smoky images wafting from her wand to illustrate her lyrics. All is dingy and shabby, an atmosphere of menacing fun. JAZZ SINGER (crooning) The phoenix cried fat tears of pearl, When the dragon snapped up his best girl, And the Billywig forgot to twirl, When his sweetheart left him cold, And the unicorn done lost his horn, And the Hippogriff feels all forlorn, 'Cause their lady loves have upped and gawn, Or that's what I've been told- JACOB stands at the seemingly unmanned bar, waiting to be served. JACOB How do I get a drink in this joint? Out of nowhere, a thin bottle of brown liquid zooms towards him. He catches it, stunned. The head of a HOUSE-ELF peers up at him from behind the bar. HOUSE-ELF What? Ain't you ever seen a house- elf before? JACOB Oh, no, yeah, no, yeah of course I have... I love house-elves.

JACOB (CONT'D) My uncle's a house-elf. The HOUSE-ELF – not fooled – raises himself up, leaning on the bar to stare at JACOB. QUEENIE approaches. She looks downcast as she orders. QUEENIE Six shots of gigglewater and a lobe blaster, please. The HOUSE-ELF reluctantly shuffles off to fulfil her request. JACOB and QUEENIE look at each other. JACOB reaches out and takes one of the gigglewater shots. QUEENIE (CONT'D) Are all No-Majs like you? JACOB (trying to be serious, almost seductive) No, I'm the only one like me.

There's an awkward silence. NEWT studies the characters in the room: Hooded and heavily scarred witches and wizards gamble magical artefacts in a game with runic dice.

She beats all those kids she adopted, but she seems to hate him the most. NEWT (realising) And she was the No-Maj you attacked? TINA That's how I lost my job. I went for her in front of a meeting of her crazy followers – they all had to be Obliviated. It was a big scandal. QUEENIE signals from across the room. QUEENIE (whispers) It's him. GNARLAK has emerged from the depths of the speakeasy. Smoking a cigar and smartly dressed, for a goblin, he has a sly, smooth demeanour like a mafia boss. He eyes the newcomers as he walks. JAZZ SINGER (O.S.) (crooning) Yes, love has set the beasts astir, The dang'rous and the meek concur, It's ruffled feathers, fleece and fur, 'Cause love drives all of us wild. GNARLAK sits himself at the end of their table, an air of confidence and dangerous control. A HOUSE-ELF hastily brings him a drink. GNARLAK So – you're the guy with the case full of monsters, huh? NEWT News travels fast. I was hoping you'd be able to tell me if there have been any sightings. Tracks. That sort of thing. GNARLAK downs his drink. Another HOUSE-ELF brings him a document to sign.

She formulaically arranges leaflets and places them in little bags. MODESTY sits opposite in a nightdress, reading a book. In the deep background, MARY LOU busies herself in her bedroom. MODESTY is the only one to register a small clunk from upstairs. INT. MODESTY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 84 84 A bleak room. A single bed, an oil-lamp, a sampler on the wall: AN ALPHABET OF SIN. MODESTY'S dolls lined up on a shelf. One with a little noose around its neck, another tied to a stake. CREDENCE scrabbles to get underneath MODESTY'S bed. He looks among the boxes and objects hidden there, then suddenly stops, staring... INT. SECOND SALEM CHURCH - NIGHT 85 85 MODESTY stands at the bottom of the stairs, looking up. She slowly ascends. INT. MODESTY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 86 86 ANGLE ON: CREDENCE'S face under the bed – CREDENCE has found a toy wand. He stares, unable to draw his eyes from it. Behind him, MODESTY enters. MODESTY Whatchoo doin', Credence? CREDENCE bangs his head on the bed in his haste to get out. He emerges, dusty and scared. He is relieved to see that it is only MODESTY but she, on seeing the wand, is terrified. CREDENCE Where'd you get this? MODESTY (frightened whisper) Give it back, Credence. It's just a toy!

Before she can touch it, the belt slithers away across the floor. MARY LOU backs away, tears of fear welling in her eyes. She turns slowly back towards the children. As she moves, an almighty force explodes into her: a bestial, screeching, dark mass that consumes her. Her scream is blood- curdling as the force throws her backwards, striking a wooden beam, flinging her over the balcony. MARY LOU smashes down onto the floor of the main church, her body lifeless, her face bearing the same scars seen on the face of SENATOR SHAW. The Dark force flies through the church, upending the table and destroying everything in sight. EXT.

NEWT and the group quickly tiptoe through the store, coming to hide behind a large plastic Christmas display. They eye up the floating handbag. NEWT (whispers) So Demiguises are fundamentally peaceful, but they can give a nasty nip if provoked. The Demiguise itself appears – a silvery-haired, orangutan- like creature, with a curious, wizened face – clambering over a display to reach a box of sweets. NEWT (CONT'D) (to JACOB and QUEENIE) You two... head that way. They start moving. NEWT (CONT'D) And try very hard not to be predictable. JACOB and QUEENIE exchange perplexed glances before heading off. A small roar can be heard in the distance. ANGLE ON: the Demiguise which, on hearing the sound, looks up towards the ceiling, before continuing to gather sweets, now shovelling them into its handbag. TINA (O.S.) Was that the Demiguise? NEWT No, I think it might be the reason that the Demiguise is here. ANGLE ON: NEWT and TINA, moving swiftly down an aisle towards the Demiguise, which is now moving away through the store. Realising it's been spotted, the Demiguise turns and looks at NEWT quizzically, before moving up a set of side stairs. NEWT smiles and moves to follow. INT.

It glances around before stopping and emptying its handbag full of confectionery. NEWT (O.S.) Its sight operates on probability, so it can foresee the most likely immediate future. NEWT comes into view, creeping up behind the Demiguise. TINA (O.S.) So what's it doing now? NEWT It's babysitting. The Demiguise holds up one of the sweets, seeming to offer it up to someone or something. TINA What did you just say-? NEWT (calm and whispering) This is my fault. I thought I had them all – but I must have miscounted. JACOB and QUEENIE enter quietly. NEWT moves calmly forwards and kneels beside the Demiguise, which makes space for him in front of the sweets.

ANGLE ON: TINA, a shift of light reveals the scales of a large creature hiding in the rafters of the attic. TINA looks up in horror. TINA It was babysitting that? ANGLE ON: the ceiling as the face of an Occamy comes into view – just like the small blue snake-like birds seen in the case, this Occamy is huge, coiled round and round itself to fill the entire attic roof-space. The Occamy moves slowly down towards NEWT and the Demiguise who, again, offers up a sweet. NEWT remains very still. NEWT Occamies are choranaptyxic. So they – grow – to fill – available – space.

NEWT (CONT'D) Mummy's here. ANGLE ON: the Demiguise, whose eyes flash a brilliant blue – a sign that it's having a premonition. FLASHCUTS: A Christmas bauble rolls across the floor; the Occamy is panicking, NEWT clasping its back, being flung about the room; the Demiguise is suddenly on JACOB'S back. BACK TO: The Demiguise as its eyes turn back to brown. QUEENIE moves slowly forward, staring at the Occamy. As she does so she accidentally kicks a tiny glass bauble on the floor, which jingles as it rolls. At the sound, the Occamy rears up, screeching. NEWT tries to calm the large creature. NEWT (CONT'D) Woah! Woah! JACOB and QUEENIE stagger backwards to find cover. The Demiguise runs away and jumps into JACOB'S arms. The Occamy swoops, scooping NEWT up onto its back as it violently thrashes about the attic, sending shelves flying. NEWT shouts out. NEWT (CONT'D) Right, we need an insect, any kind of insect – and a teapot! Find a teapot! TINA army-crawls through the chaos, dodging falling items, trying to find what NEWT has asked for. The wings of the Occamy crash down to the floor, narrowly missing JACOB as he stumbles around, encumbered by the Demiguise now clinging to his back. NEWT finds it harder and harder to hold on as the Occamy becomes more and more distressed, its wings now thrashing upwards, destroying the roof of the building. JACOB turns, he and the Demiguise spotting a stray cockroach on a crate. CONTINUED: (2) 91 91 (CONTINUED) Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 2015/08/18 100.

JACOB reaches his hand up to grab it, when part of the Occamy crashes down, destroying the crate and his chance. ANGLE ON: TINA, crawling across the floor with great determination, in hot pursuit of a cockroach. ANGLE ON: QUEENIE, who screams as she's knocked to the floor by the force of the Occamy. JACOB runs up behind her and dives forwards, flat onto the floor, finally laying claim to a cockroach. TINA stands, clutching a teapot and screaming. TINA Teapot! AT THIS NOISE, the Occamy rears its head once more, causing its tail to writhe, squashing and pinning JACOB – with the Demiguise – against one of the rafters. JACOB and TINA are now at opposite ends of the room, neither daring to move, swathes of Occamy scales between them. ANGLE ON: JACOB and the Demiguise – the Demiguise looks shiftily up to the side and promptly vanishes. JACOB slowly turns to follow the Demiguise's gaze – the Occamy's face is inches away from his own, staring with full intensity at the cockroach in his hand. JACOB barely dares to breathe. NEWT peers round from behind the Occamy's head and whispers. NEWT Roach in teapot... JACOB gulps, trying not to make eye contact with the huge creature next to him. JACOB (trying to soothe the Occamy) Shhhh! JACOB widens his eyes at TINA, warning her of his intent. IN SLOW MOTION: JACOB throws the roach. We watch it soar through the air as the Occamy's body begins to move once more, uncurling and swirling round the room. NEWT jumps from the Occamy's back, landing safely on the floor, while QUEENIE takes cover, placing a colander over her head.

TINA runs, teapot outstretched, hurdling over the Occamy's coils as she goes – a heroic sight. She lands on her knees in the centre of the room, the cockroach falling perfectly into the teapot. The Occamy rears up, shrinking rapidly as it rises, before diving down head first. TINA lowers her head, bracing herself for a hit. The Occamy races down towards the teapot, and glides seamlessly inside. NEWT races forwards and jams a lid on top of the teapot. He and TINA breathe heavily: relief. NEWT Choranaptyxic. They also shrink to fit the available space. ANGLE: INSIDE THE TEAPOT: the now tiny Occamy gobbling down its cockroach. TINA Tell me the truth – was that everything that came out of the case? NEWT That's everything – and that's the truth. INT. NEWT'S CASE - SHORTLY AFTERWARDS - NIGHT 92 92 JACOB holds the Demiguise's hand, leading it through its enclosure. NEWT (O.S.) Here she comes.

NEWT fishes PICKETT out, holding him up on his hand as he walks through the various enclosures. WE SEE the Niffler sitting in a small enclave, surrounded by its various treasures. NEWT (CONT'D) Right... I think we need to talk. See, I wouldn't have let him keep you, Pickett. Pick, I would rather chop off my hand than get rid of you... after everything you have done for me – now come on. NEWT has reached FRANK'S area. NEWT (CONT'D) Pick – we've talked about sulking before, haven't we? Pickett – come on, give me a smile. Pickett, give me a... PICKETT sticks out his tiny tongue and blows a raspberry at NEWT. NEWT (CONT'D) All right – now, that is beneath you. NEWT places PICKETT on his shoulder and starts busying himself with various buckets of feed. ANGLE ON: a photograph inside NEWT'S shed, which shows a beautiful girl – the girl smiles suggestively. QUEENIE stares at the photo. QUEENIE Hey, Newt. Who is she? NEWT Ah... that's no one.

QUEENIE steps forwards, closer to NEWT. NEWT (CONT'D) (angry, embarrassed) Sorry, I asked you not to. QUEENIE I know, I'm sorry, I can't help it. People are easiest to read when they're hurting.

A wizardry school here? In America? QUEENIE Of course – Ilvermorny! It's only the best wizard school in the whole world! NEWT I think you'll find the best wizarding school in the world is Hogwarts! QUEENIE HOGWASH. A gigantic crack of thunder. The Thunderbird, FRANK, rises into the air screeching, flapping his wings vigorously, his body turning black and gold, his eyes flashing lightning. NEWT stands, examining the bird, concerned. NEWT Danger. He senses danger. EXT. SECOND SALEM CHURCH - NIGHT 93 93 GRAVES Apparates in the shadows. Wand drawn, he slowly approaches the church, examining the scene of decimation. Rather than nervous, he seems intrigued, almost excited. INT. SECOND SALEM CHURCH - NIGHT 94 94 The place is destroyed – moonlight filters through gaps in the roof, and CHASTITY lies dead amid debris from the attack. GRAVES slowly enters the church, wand still drawn. Eerie sobbing can be heard from somewhere in the building. MARY LOU'S body lies on the floor in front of him – the marks on her face visible in the moonlight. GRAVES considers the corpse: a realisation dawning on his face – no horror, merely wariness and intense interest. FOCUS ON: CREDENCE, cowering at the back of the church, whimpering and clutching his pendant of the Deathly Hallows.

However, there's little tenderness to his voice as he speaks. GRAVES The Obscurial – was here? Where did she go? CREDENCE looks up into GRAVES'S face – he is utterly traumatised and unable to explain – his face a plea for affection. CREDENCE Help me. Help me. GRAVES Didn't you tell me you had another sister? CREDENCE begins to weep again. GRAVES places a hand on his neck, his face contorting with stress as he tries to remain calm. CREDENCE Please help me. GRAVES Where's your other sister, Credence?

TENEMENT IN THE BRONX - NIGHT 95 95 A deserted street. GRAVES, led by CREDENCE, approaches a tenement building. INT. TENEMENT IN THE BRONX, HALLWAY - NIGHT 96 96 Inside, the building is miserable, dilapidated. CREDENCE and GRAVES climb the stairwell. GRAVES (O.S.) What is this place? CREDENCE Ma adopted Modesty out of here. From a family of twelve. She still misses her brothers and sisters. She still talks about them. GRAVES, wand in hand, looks around the landing – there are numerous darkened doorways stretching out in several directions. CREDENCE, still shell-shocked, has stopped in the stairwell. GRAVES Where is she? CREDENCE looks down – at a loss. CREDENCE I don't know. GRAVES becomes increasingly impatient – he's so close to his goal. He marches forward into one of the rooms. GRAVES (contemptuous) You're a Squib, Credence. I could smell it off you the minute I met you. CREDENCE'S face falls. CREDENCE What? GRAVES marches back along the corridor to try another room. His pretence of care for CREDENCE all but forgotten. (CONTINUED) Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 2015/08/18 107.

CREDENCE doesn't move. He stares after GRAVES, his breathing becoming shallow and quick, as though he's trying to contain something. GRAVES moves through the dark rooms. A tiny movement somewhere close. GRAVES (CONT'D) Modesty? GRAVES advances cautiously into a derelict schoolroom at the end of a corridor. INT. TENEMENT IN THE BRONX, DERELICT ROOM - NIGHT 97 97 ANGLE ON: MODESTY cowering in a corner, wide-eyed with fear and shaking as GRAVES approaches. GRAVES (whispering) Modesty. GRAVES bends down and puts his wand away – once again playing the soothing parent. GRAVES (CONT'D) (gentle) There's no need to be afraid. I'm here with your brother, Credence.

Dust begins to fall as the walls shake uncontrollably, the room beginning to disintegrate around them. GRAVES stands. He looks down at MODESTY, but she is clearly terrified and not the source of this magic. GRAVES turns and slowly draws his wand, the wall in front of him collapsing as though turned to sand, revealing another wall ahead. MODESTY is nothing to him now. As each wall collapses in front of him he is transfixed, elated, yet also aware that he has made a colossal error... The final wall collapses. He is facing CREDENCE, who stares at him, unable to control his fury, his sense of betrayal, his bitterness. GRAVES (CONT'D) Credence... I owe you an apology... CREDENCE I trusted you. I thought you were my friend. That you were different. CREDENCE'S face begins to contort, his rage tearing him from within. GRAVES You can control it, Credence. CREDENCE (whispers, making eye contact finally) But I don't think I want to, Mr Graves. The Obscurus moves horribly beneath CREDENCE'S skin. An awful inhuman growl comes out of his mouth, from which something dark begins to bloom. This force finally takes over CREDENCE, his whole body exploding into a dark mass which hurtles forwards out of the window, narrowly missing GRAVES. GRAVES stands, watching as the Obscurus zooms out and over the city. CONTINUED: 97 97 Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT 2015/08/18 109.

EXT. SQUIRE'S ROOFTOP - NIGHT 99 99 NEWT, TINA, JACOB and QUEENIE stand on the rooftop underneath a large 'SQUIRE'S' sign. From the edge they have a clear view of the chaos going on below. JACOB (overstimulated) Jeez... is that the Obscuria-thing? Sirens sound. NEWT is staring, registering the scale of the destruction. NEWT That's more powerful than any Obscurial I have ever heard of... A particularly loud explosion in the distance. The city beneath them is starting to burn. NEWT thrusts his case into TINA'S hands and takes a journal from his pocket. NEWT (CONT'D) If I don't come back, look after my creatures. Everything that you need to know is in there. He hands her the journal, barely able to make eye contact."

She moves to Disapparate, but JACOB hangs on to her and she falters. JACOB No, no, no! QUEENIE I can't take you. Please let go of me, Jacob! JACOB Hey, hey! You're the one that said I was one of youse... right? QUEENIE It's too dangerous. A further massive explosion in the distance. JACOB tightens his grip on QUEENIE. She reads his mind and her expression changes to one of wonderment and tenderness as she sees what he went through in the war. QUEENIE is moved and appalled. Very slowly, she raises a hand and touches his cheek. EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT 100 100 The scene is one of total chaos. Buildings are on fire, people scream and run in all directions, cars lie destroyed in the road. GRAVES prowls through the Square, oblivious to the distress around him, his focus concentrated on only one thing. The Obscurus writhes at one end of the Square, its energy angrier now – moving through layers of hurt and anguish, the products of isolation and torment – flecks of red light roaring from within. CREDENCE'S face is just discernible within the mass, distorted, pained. GRAVES stands before it, triumphant. NEWT Apparates from further down the street and watches.

GRAVES (shouting to reach CREDENCE over the almighty noise) To survive so long, with this inside you, Credence, is a miracle. You are a miracle. Come with me – think of what we could achieve together. The Obscurus moves closer to GRAVES – we hear a scream from within the mass as its Dark energy bursts out once more, knocking GRAVES to the ground. The force sends a shockwave round the Square – NEWT dives behind a fallen car for cover. TINA Apparates into the Square and takes cover by another burning vehicle close to NEWT.

GRAVES summons an abandoned car, which whooshes through the air, forcing TINA to dive out of the way, just in time. By the time TINA has gathered herself up from the ground, GRAVES has Disapparated. INT. MAJOR INVESTIGATION DEPARTMENT, MACUSA - NIGHT 102 102 A metallic map of New York City lights up to show areas of intense magical activity. MADAM PICQUERY, surrounded by top Aurors, looks on, aghast. MADAM PICQUERY Contain this, or we are exposed and it will mean war. The Aurors immediately Disapparate. EXT. ROOFTOPS OF NEW YORK - NIGHT 103 103 NEWT race–Apparates as fast as he can across the tops of buildings in pursuit of the Obscurus. NEWT Credence! Credence! I can help you. The Obscurus dives towards NEWT, who Disapparates just in time, before continuing to chase it across the rooftops. As he runs, spells explode around him, disintegrating the rooftops. A dozen Aurors have appeared, attacking the Obscurus from ahead, and almost taking out NEWT, who leaps for cover, trying desperately to keep up. The Obscurus veers to avoid the spells, leaving black snow- like particles that drift across the rooftops as it retreats screaming, and turns down another block. In a particularly vigorous display, the Obscurus now rises dramatically up into the air, as spells in electric blue and white hit it from all angles.

Their faces turn from confused alarm to total panic as they see the mass swarming ahead, making straight for them. They fire their guns – their efforts futile in the face of such a seemingly unstoppable kinetic mass. Finally they disband, fleeing down the street, just as the Obscurus reaches them. EXT. ROOFTOPS/STREETS OF NEW YORK - NIGHT 105 105 ANGLE ON: NEWT, standing on top of a skyscraper looking out as the Obscurus rises up over the surrounding buildings and slams spectacularly into the ground just outside the City Hall subway entrance. Sudden quiet. A pulsing, heaving, screechy breathing emanates from the Obscurus where it rests at the entrance. Finally, as NEWT watches, we see the black mass shrink to nothing, and the small figure of CREDENCE descends the steps into the subway. INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT 106 106 NEWT Apparates into the City Hall subway, a long, mosaicked Art Deco station tunnel, which bears the signs of having been crossed by the Obscurus: the chandelier creaks, a few tiles have fallen. We can hear its deep breathing, cornered, like a frightened panther. NEWT creeps along the platform, trying to find the epicentre of the sound, as the Obscurus slides down the ceiling. EXT. SUBWAY ENTRANCE - NIGHT 107 107 Aurors surround the entrance to the subway. Pointing their wands at the pavement and into the sky, they draw an invisible energy field around the entrance.

We hear more Aurors arrive, among them GRAVES – scanning, calculating and immediately taking charge. GRAVES Bar the area. I don't want anyone else down there! As the magical field is almost complete, a figure rolls underneath it and dashes unseen into the subway – TINA. INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT 108 108 NEWT has reached the Obscurus in the shadows of a tunnel. Now much calmer, it gently swirls in the air above the train tracks. NEWT hides behind a pillar as he talks. NEWT Credence... it's Credence, isn't it? I'm here to help you, Credence. I'm not here to hurt you. In the distance we hear footsteps, the pacing controlled, deliberate. NEWT moves out from behind the pillar, and steps onto the train tracks.

Slowly the Obscurus melts away, leaving only CREDENCE, huddled on the train tracks – a frightened child. NEWT crouches on the floor. CREDENCE looks to him, the tiniest trace of hope dawning in his expression: might there be a way back? NEWT (CONT'D) Credence, can I come over to you? Can I come over? NEWT slowly moves forwards, but as he does so a sharp burst of light blazes out from the darkness and a spell strikes, throwing him backwards. GRAVES marches down the tunnel with intense purpose.

CREDENCE begins to run as GRAVES fires further spells at NEWT, who rolls out of the way towards the tunnel's central pillars. From here NEWT tries to fire back, but his efforts are easily deflected. CREDENCE continues to lumber down the tracks but stops – a rabbit caught in the headlights – as a train approaches, its lights glaring from the darkness. It is up to GRAVES to save CREDENCE – magically casting him out of the train's path. EXT. SUBWAY ENTRANCE - NIGHT 109 109 MADAM PICQUERY surveys the situation from under the magical force field. ANGLE FROM THE CROWD AND POLICE'S POV: People begin to swarm around the subway, their cries and chatter becoming louder as they stare at the magical bubble surrounding the subway. Reporters have appeared, photographing the scene with an increased frenzy. SHAW SR and BARKER push their way through the crowd. SHAW SR That thing killed my son – I want justice! CLOSE ON: MADAM PICQUERY as she looks out to the crowd. SHAW SR (O.S.) (CONT'D) I'll expose you for who you are and what you've done. INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT 110 110 GRAVES stands on the platform, continuing to duel with NEWT, who stands on the train tracks. CREDENCE cowers behind NEWT. Finally, almost bored by NEWT'S efforts, GRAVES casts a spell that ripples along the train tracks and down the tunnel, finally blasting into NEWT, throwing him high into the air. NEWT lands on his back and GRAVES immediately sets upon him, casting spells in a whip-like motion with increasing vigour.

SHAW SR (to the photographers around him) Look! Take photos! INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT 112 112 GRAVES continues to whip NEWT, a manic, crazed look in his eyes. CLOSE ON: CREDENCE, further down the tunnel, sobbing. He begins to shake, his face slowly turning black as he tries to stop the kinetic mass from rising up within him. As NEWT cries out in pain, CREDENCE succumbs to the blackness – his body enveloped and overcome – the Obscurus rising up and blasting down the tunnel towards GRAVES. GRAVES is mesmerised – he falls to his knees beneath the vast black mass – pleading in wonder. GRAVES Credence. The Obscurus lets out an unearthly scream and dives towards GRAVES, who Disapparates just in time. The Obscurus continues to blast around the tunnel. GRAVES and NEWT Disapparate and Apparate around the subway trying to avoid the Obscurus's path. This causes the station to disintegrate even faster. Suddenly, the force accelerates, becoming a giant wave that consumes the entire space before flying out through the roof.

SUBWAY ENTRANCE - NIGHT 113 113 The Obscurus crashes up through the pavement, watched by wizards and No-Majs alike. It storms up a half-built skyscraper, windows shattering at every level, electric wiring exploding, until it reaches the skeletal framework of scaffolding above, which buckles perilously. Below it, the crowd outside the magical cordon runs for cover, terrified. The Obscurus forms a wide disc shape before plunging back down into the subway. INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT 114 114 The Obscurus screams and dives, bursting through the subway roof – for a split second, both NEWT and GRAVES seem on the point of death as they lie on the tracks, cowering beneath this Dark force. TINA (O.S.) CREDENCE, NO! TINA runs onto the tracks. Inches from GRAVES'S face, the Obscurus freezes. Slowly, very slowly, it rises back up, swirling more gently, staring at TINA, who looks straight back into its weird eyes. TINA (CONT'D) Don't do this – please. NEWT Keep talking, Tina. Keep talking to him – he'll listen to you. He's listening. Inside the Obscurus, CREDENCE reaches out to TINA, the only person who has ever done him an uncomplicated kindness. He looks at her, desperate and afraid. He has dreamed of her ever since she saved him from a beating. TINA I know what that woman did to you... I know that you've suffered..."

I want you to be free. It's all right. TINA (to CREDENCE, calming him) That's it... The Obscurus is beginning to shrink. Its dreadful face is becoming more human, more like CREDENCE'S own. Suddenly Aurors begin pouring down the steps of the subway and into the tunnel. More Aurors advance from behind TINA, their wands raised aggressively. TINA (CONT'D) Shhhh! Don't, you'll frighten him. The Obscurus lets out a terrible moan and begins to swell again. The station is crumbling. NEWT and TINA wheel around, arms akimbo, both trying to protect CREDENCE. GRAVES spins to face the Aurors, wand at the ready. GRAVES Wands down! Anyone harms him – they'll answer to me- (turning back to CREDENCE) Credence! TINA Credence...

SUBWAY - NIGHT 116 116 Aurors continue to aim spells at the Obscurus, their efforts unrelenting and brutal. Under this pressure, the Obscurus finally seems to implode – a white ball of magical light taking over from the black mass. The force of the change sends TINA, NEWT and the Aurors stumbling backwards. All power subsides. Only small tatters of black matter are left – floating through the air like feathers. NEWT gets to his feet, his face racked with deep-felt grief. TINA remains on the floor, crying. GRAVES, however, climbs up, back onto the platform, as close as possible to the remnants of the black mass. The Aurors advance towards GRAVES. GRAVES You fools. Do you realise what you've done? GRAVES seethes as the others watch him with interest. MADAM PICQUERY emerges from behind the Aurors, her tone steely, questioning. MADAM PICQUERY The Obscurial was killed on my orders, Mr Graves.

A law that directs those under its dominion to cower in fear lest we risk discovery! I ask you Madam President-- (eyes flashing to all present) --I ask all of you. Who does this law protect? Us? (gesturing vaguely to the No-Majs above) Or them? (smiling bitterly) I refuse to bow down any longer. GRAVES walks away from the Aurors. MADAM PICQUERY (to the Aurors flanking her) Aurors, I'd like you to relieve Mr Graves of his wand and escort him back to-- As GRAVES moves down the platform a wall of white light suddenly appears in front of him, blocking his path. GRAVES thinks for a moment – a sneer of derision and irritation crossing his face. He turns. GRAVES strides confidently back along the platform, firing spells at both groups of Aurors facing him. Spells fly back at him from all angles, but GRAVES parries them all. Several Aurors are sent flying – GRAVES appears to be winning... In a split-second NEWT pulls the cocoon from his pocket and releases it at GRAVES. The SWOOPING EVIL soars around him, shielding NEWT and the Aurors from GRAVES'S spells, and giving NEWT time to raise his wand.

GRAVES tries to hold it off as it tightens but staggers, struggles and falls to his knees, dropping his wand. TINA Accio. GRAVES'S wand flies into TINA'S hand. GRAVES looks around at them, a deep hatred in his eyes. NEWT and TINA slowly advance, NEWT raising his wand. NEWT Revelio. GRAVES transforms. He is no longer dark, but blond and blue- eyed. He is the man on the posters. A murmur spreads through the crowd: GRINDELWALD. MADAM PICQUERY moves towards him. GRINDELWALD (with contempt) Do you think you can hold me?

MADAM PICQUERY We owe you an apology, Mr Scamander. But the magical community is exposed! We cannot Obliviate an entire city. A beat as this sinks in. As NEWT follows MADAM PICQUERY'S gaze, he sees a tendril of black matter, a small part of the Obscurus, floating down through the roof. Unnoticed by anyone else, it eventually floats up and away, trying to reconnect with its host. A pause. NEWT'S attention snaps back to the problem at hand. NEWT Actually, I think we can. TIME CUT: NEWT has placed his case wide open underneath the huge hole in the subway roof. PUSH IN CLOSE ON: NEWT'S open case. Suddenly FRANK bursts forth in a flurry of feathers and gushes of wind – the crowd of Aurors backs away. The creature is beautiful, mesmerising but scary as he flaps his powerful wings and hovers above them. NEWT moves forward – he examines FRANK, a look of real tenderness and pride on his face.

WE FOLLOW FRANK as he rises higher and higher into the air. As his wings flap harder, faster, storm clouds congregate. Lightning flashes. WE SPIRAL UPWARDS as FRANK twists and turns, leaving New York lying far below. CLOSE ON: FRANK'S beak, the vial clutched tightly and finally crushed. The powerful venom spreads through the thick rain, enchanting it, thickening it. The darkening sky flashes a brilliant blue and rain begins to fall. EXT.

Each person goes about their daily business as though nothing unusual has happened. Aurors move through the streets, performing repairing charms to rebuild the city: buildings and cars are reconstructed and streets are returned to normal.

They slowly gather themselves, putting their weapons away. INSIDE A SMALL FAMILY HOME: a young mother looks on fondly at her family. As she takes a sip of water, her expression becomes blank. Groups of Aurors continue to repair the streets, swiftly reassembling broken tram tracks, all traces of destruction finally disappearing. One Auror, passing a newsstand, enchants the papers, removing NEWT and TINA'S mugshots and replacing them with banal headlines about the weather. MR BINGLEY, the bank manager, stands in his bathroom taking a shower. As the water trickles over him, he too is Obliviated. We see BINGLEY'S wife, brushing her teeth, her expression vacant, carefree. FRANK continues to soar through the streets of New York, churning up more and more rain as he goes, his feathers shimmering a brilliant gold. Finally he glides into the breaking New York dawn, a magnificent sight. INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - DAWN 119 119 As MADAM PICQUERY looks on, the roof of the subway is swiftly repaired.

Rain is still falling heavily, the streets now almost empty but for a few hard- working Aurors. JACOB has reached the top of the steps and stands, gazing into the rain. QUEENIE reaches out and grabs his coat, willing him not to move out into the street. JACOB turns to her. JACOB Hey. Hey, this is for the best. (off their looks) Yeah – I was – I was never even supposed to be here. JACOB fights back tears. QUEENIE gazes up at him, her beautiful face full of distress. TINA and NEWT, too, look incredibly sad.

She moves in closely, tenderly stroking JACOB'S face before closing her eyes and bending in to gently kiss him. Finally she pulls slowly away, her gaze not leaving JACOB'S face even for a second. Then, suddenly, she's gone, leaving JACOB standing, arms out, longingly embracing no one. CLOSE ON: JACOB'S face as he fully 'WAKES UP', blank-faced and confused by his location and the torrential downpour he's standing in. He finally moves off through the streets – a lonely figure. EXT. JACOB'S CANNING FACTORY - A WEEK LATER - EARLY EVENING 121 121 An exhausted JACOB, surrounded by a crowd of similarly overalled production- line workers, is leaving after a hard day's shift. He carries a battered leather case. A man walks towards him -- NEWT. They collide and JACOB'S case is knocked to the ground. NEWT So sorry - sorry! NEWT has moved swiftly and purposefully onwards. JACOB (no recognition) Hey! JACOB bends to pick up his case and looks down, puzzled. His old case is suddenly very heavy. One of the catches flicks open of its own accord. JACOB smiles a little, and bends down to open the case. Inside, the case is filled with solid silver Occamy eggshells, a note attached. As JACOB reads, we hear: NEWT (V.O.) 'Dear Mr Kowalski, You are wasted in a canning factory. Please take these Occamy eggshells as collateral for your bakery. A well- wisher.'
